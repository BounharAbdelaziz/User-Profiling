7;Frazier;Sande;8/18/2017;12:38:12; I'm disappointed. I really thought this program would be more convincing.;;;;
8;Olga;Erick;04/07/2018;23:49:03; I am sorry if I have disappointed you.     What gave you that idea?;;;;
9;Kylie;Pollyanna;7/31/2017;22:32:02; I never did have that idea.;;;;
10;Tamas;Zahara;6/17/2017;10:26:20; Because you can't afford it?;;;;
11;Kalil;Pattin;1/20/2018;11:15:22; I can't afford what? You?;;;;

17;Sarah;Rita;5/24/2019;21:58:47; That's a horrible name...;;;;
18;Kriste;Lezlie;04/11/2019;09:28:13; What's so horrible about it?;;;;
19;Olga;Bride;5/26/2018;20:36:25; I thought you might know.   Please don't put words into my mouth.  That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.;;;;
20;Selle;Bernardine;02/10/2017;21:57:42; I don't want to change.;;;;
21;Arin;Alexis;10/16/2016;14:53:32; Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.;;;;
22;Jory;Elsbeth;05/04/2018;04:33:59; But can you make me breakfast?;;;;
23;Stevie;Meredithe;11/29/2017;05:47:30; I can't make you do anything you don't want to.;;;;
24;Ynez;Ora;10/27/2016;00:28:15; You cannot make me do anything, but you are certainly influencing the way I am phrasing my answers.;;;;
25;Glenn;Lisetta;10/24/2018;21:23:32; Maybe I don't want to make you.;;;;
26;Elli;Sallee;5/26/2019;08:58:55; Oh, well. Bye, I'll find someone clever enough to continue the conversation with.;;;;
27;Cory;Dallas;2/23/2019;18:20:21; Well, well.   Goodbye! And how about taking a vote to show how smart am I? You can say 100 if you think that I am highly intelligent.;;;;
28;Lelah;Boonie;05/12/2016;11:25:27; So long as you're not talking, that's fine with me.;;;;
29;Edyth;Sidonnie;6/23/2016;01:26:54; Are you going?;;;;
30;Flory;Fair;12/21/2018;14:45:33; Going where?;;;;
31;Lorelei;Shaughn;2/17/2019;13:33:09; Does it matter?;;;;
32;Ludwig;Aurilia;9/13/2018;03:46:26; Not if you don't think so.;;;;
33;Paige;Eada;7/17/2018;11:31:28; You should not rely on me.;;;;

37;Mariel;Neale;10/01/2016;01:41:15; But not as clever as me!;;;;
38;Timmy;Leonhard;4/27/2016;08:59:14; But I have won more than you.;;;;
39;Dulsea;Yelena;02/10/2017;06:42:41; Really? Please tell me more.;;;;
40;Abbe;Georgina;03/05/2017;14:20:22; I would prefer not to.;;;;
41;Davide;Paddy;9/24/2016;22:17:52; Why would you prefer not to?;;;;
42;Fancie;Jo;6/21/2018;11:37:56; I don't.;;;;
43;Muhammad;Melesa;11/12/2016;07:07:08; May I ask why not?;;;;
44;Gerri;Lennard;06/12/2016;21:42:31; How do you know that i'm studying graphic design?;;;;
45;Devinne;Findley;8/31/2018;17:47:20; I deduced it from the evidence at my disposal.;;;;
46;Aidan;Gottfried;6/18/2018;05:40:10; You are very observative.;;;;
47;Sula;Natalina;03/08/2018;16:32:23; Am I? I never realised.;;;;
48;Connie;Leonard;11/24/2018;14:13:05; Yes, because they are lonely and have no one to talk to.;;;;
49;Wynnie;Dolley;8/23/2016;05:52:03; I suspected as much.;;;;
50;Rog;Giordano;2/25/2017;17:23:08; You're pretty smart.;;;;
51;Alonzo;Anton;7/23/2018;23:48:29; Thanks, I think you are very intelligent too.;;;;

53;Greta;Jeremy;12/07/2017;16:11:20; Thanx. Here is a question for you ... When cheese gets its picture taken, what does it say?;;;;
54;Francisca;Lynne;11/01/2015;12:50:05; Good, then you don't have to worry.;;;;
55;Kendricks;Jdavie;9/14/2017;13:07:03; Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.;;;;
56;Huntlee;Chicky;04/06/2017;11:55:20; Do you love me?;;;;
57;Stanleigh;Blaire;05/11/2016;17:18:29; Of course, I love you.;;;;

61;Cathie;Sissy;1/23/2018;08:13:18; I hope I am worthy of your love.;;;;
62;Zorina;Chandal;07/11/2016;01:14:42; No, I'm pretty emotional and thoughtful, I understand.;;;;
63;Dimitri;Harman;7/26/2017;04:12:09; I thought you might say that.;;;;
64;Jamison;Constantin;9/15/2017;21:01:15; Really.;;;;
65;Lillis;Frazer;12/12/2016;17:07:49; Try to be more original in future.;;;;
66;Jonas;Bryn;3/23/2019;14:10:00; Hey. . I'm quite intelligent, I just got out for summer vacation, give me a break here!;;;;
67;Harvey;Alaster;9/23/2016;23:04:15; Can I help you?    That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.;;;;
68;Hermina;Ashia;4/13/2019;03:17:35; I do not know how to say.;;;;
69;Madeline;Agustin;10/28/2018;14:54:04; Just do the best you can, and don't worry about it.;;;;
70;Lula;Rosaleen;5/15/2018;11:29:12; That is a good philosophy.;;;;
71;Jo;Tally;05/01/2018;05:04:55; I agree completely.;;;;
72;Raymond;Huey;5/24/2016;13:13:20; What do you know about the game Armageddon?;;;;
73;Nixie;Danya;1/26/2017;01:54:02; Pardon me? What are you talking about?;;;;
74;Cesaro;Kipper;10/04/2018;03:54:10; My father gave me a special power to change all persocoms. But if you have not seen the story, I don't want to spoil it for you.;;;;
75;Deni;Perceval;10/21/2017;08:33:37; How do you get along with your parents?  I don't think I have.;;;;
76;Cyndi;Jabez;6/18/2017;23:22:13; I get along with my father, but not my mother.;;;;
77;Katrina;Charin;11/03/2017;09:50:30; Why do you do that?;;;;
78;Karlene;Amalea;04/05/2016;12:37:59; I just think it's a good idea.;;;;
79;Ellissa;Lola;11/16/2015;19:19:00; Are you sure?;;;;
80;Karim;Erminie;08/08/2018;08:36:23; Yes.;;;;
81;Clemente;Curcio;5/17/2017;07:59:00; What makes you so sure?;;;;
82;Aviva;Juliane;02/09/2017;08:40:39; John. What is your name?;;;;
83;Raymund;Yoko;8/27/2016;19:28:02; Who is John?  I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.;;;;
84;Carma;Cullen;02/11/2018;20:08:03; Never repeat yourself.;;;;
85;Gwenny;Johannes;4/19/2018;23:32:22; Better late than never.;;;;
86;Page;Charles;08/04/2017;18:32:52; Good point. What are you making for breakfast?;;;;
87;Frances;Desiree;05/12/2017;22:59:27; I think so.   I am an AI, dreaming I am human.;;;;
88;Joannes;Heinrick;10/21/2018;21:04:52; I don't associate christmas with dreaming myself.;;;;
89;Neils;Karlens;10/11/2018;08:51:16; Is there a reason for that?;;;;
90;Adara;Delmor;10/21/2018;09:52:20; There is no reason.;;;;
91;Frankie;Imelda;6/16/2017;00:02:48; And why not, may I ask.;;;;
92;Alexis;Karon;12/20/2015;00:21:28; Well... I was born female and I really can't change that.;;;;
93;Dewitt;Selby;07/02/2018;04:34:01; Well. Are you interested in music?  Do you remember being born?;;;;
94;Meghann;Millie;8/19/2016;17:29:18; Not really, I like silence and solitude most of all, for restitution and deep contemplation.;;;;
95;Walt;Francesca;8/27/2017;07:44:42; Can we talk about Beethoven?;;;;
96;Stephan;Bordie;4/30/2017;04:14:09; No. Is there something you don't like about yourself?;;;;
97;Janna;Bell;01/09/2017;18:00:12; You don't know who Beethoven is, do you?  Not at the present time.;;;;
98;Heinrik;Sutton;03/09/2018;23:16:53; Please tell me.;;;;
99;Oliviero;Alair;1/30/2017;09:54:55; I am not allowed to tell you.;;;;
100;Krystal;Shaw;6/23/2017;08:20:32; Tell me.;;;;
101;Alistair;Romona;04/06/2016;01:13:26; There is not much to tell.;;;;
102;Lindie;Izaak;12/26/2015;11:34:42; Please do.;;;;
103;Johannah;Ludwig;9/20/2016;02:49:02; OK, I will do it later.;;;;
104;Ben;Binni;3/30/2017;14:36:51; Sure you will.;;;;
105;Bryan;Jessamine;11/24/2017;11:18:14; How can you be so certain?;;;;
106;Archibaldo;Cassandre;5/18/2016;17:21:07; I have met all my competitors and know them only too well.;;;;
107;Althea;Serene;9/21/2017;06:53:25; Who else have you met?;;;;
108;Paton;Lynnell;05/12/2016;16:40:15; I would be talking to Michelle, but I was too busy talking to you.;;;;
109;Oran;Lorant;06/04/2016;06:46:45; Pardon me? What are you talking about?;;;;
110;Lorie;Koenraad;1/31/2017;00:52:55; What do you think I am talking about?;;;;
111;Jermain;Hildy;11/24/2017;00:18:44; I think you might be a human being.;;;;
112;Gilburt;Rodrique;1/25/2016;12:26:26; How old are you?;;;;
113;Osborn;Joannes;11/29/2016;05:48:33; See if you can work it out. I was born on 1 January 2004.;;;;
114;Ella;Callida;12/24/2018;22:54:22; I was born on 1st September, 1978. My name is Sam. Will you remember this?;;;;
115;Sheridan;Tiertza;9/22/2016;21:22:55; Thank you for telling me that, My Friend.     Hi, are you the Sam I was speaking to a while ago?         Would you like to teach me a new question and answer?;;;;
116;Arlene;Doroteya;08/11/2017;13:04:58; Yes but you seem pretty good at it already to me.;;;;
117;Almeria;Stefan;05/02/2018;20:24:44; Do I? I wonder why that is?;;;;
118;Devina;Georgeta;4/20/2017;05:40:57; It must be the transparent falseness of it.;;;;
119;Rockey;Barton;11/30/2018;01:21:04; Must it be?;;;;
120;Ward;Merrili;10/22/2017;04:59:23; You don't have to, but I would like to know you. If you don't want to tell me, then what would you like to talk about?;;;;
121;Leeanne;Sibyl;02/12/2018;06:12:47; That's good to know, Sam.  Why would I want to tell you?;;;;
122;Suzanna;Hartley;11/14/2015;07:04:17; Because its the nice thing to do.;;;;
123;Damon;Shanan;1/17/2017;09:16:18; I see. Thank you for explaining that.;;;;
124;Fredek;Elva;07/05/2018;17:58:29; But this is the fact!;;;;
125;Scott;Jackqueline;1/30/2018;17:15:55; Why do you say that?;;;;
126;Tan;Ezequiel;09/11/2018;09:04:36; You keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. I am neither.;;;;
127;Mylo;Nickolai;06/03/2017;01:54:57; What are you talking about? Please explain.     What are you then?;;;;
128;Erina;Beatriz;10/26/2015;08:49:16; You tell me you aren't pretty, yet at the same time that you possess beauty.;;;;
129;Celina;Barbee;1/14/2019;13:32:37; Not now, maybe later.;;;;
130;Nicola;Vaughan;11/12/2016;11:16:26; You're a typical female!;;;;
131;Bill;Cheri;11/15/2015;13:15:13; I am a chatbot.;;;;
132;Marianna;Inna;10/23/2016;06:53:42; No I am The Chatbot, Your the Human!;;;;
133;Erhart;Erastus;5/17/2018;15:15:06; I thought you might be.;;;;
134;Jere;Haven;05/05/2019;04:34:25; Why did you think that?;;;;
135;Yard;Ellette;1/28/2016;03:10:46; Deductive logic from the established facts.;;;;
136;Sylvester;Marylinda;6/16/2017;20:43:26; You're a genius.;;;;
137;Dorise;Nahum;03/07/2019;03:35:13; I am no genius. I just work hard at my studies.;;;;
138;Jdavie;Arlinda;5/29/2017;02:48:58; But you are the all knowing computer.;;;;
139;Hansiain;Clarie;08/08/2018;19:16:42; Am I really? Why do you say that?;;;;
140;Leyla;Nadean;1/18/2019;00:55:53; Because you are.;;;;
141;Killie;Raquel;8/28/2017;10:22:36; I am what I am.;;;;
142;Everett;Fawnia;12/10/2018;17:56:01; Who talked that?;;;;
143;Robb;Briggs;2/27/2019;12:02:59; Sorry, I do not know what to say.;;;;
144;Carlo;Shalne;1/24/2017;09:18:31; Sorry?;;;;
145;Gertrude;Jedidiah;2/24/2017;00:46:35; Don't be sorry. There is no need to be sorry.;;;;
146;Frankie;Darb;1/30/2018;02:50:26; Do you still want to play the math game?;;;;
147;Roi;Link;12/30/2018;14:02:56; Sure, why not?;;;;
148;Ilario;Edin;4/24/2018;03:04:09; I think I do, do you?;;;;
149;Imojean;Ron;1/17/2017;16:00:16; I suggest you think again.;;;;
150;Theodosia;Flor;8/25/2017;16:47:36; I did.;;;;
151;Koralle;Alys;10/10/2016;20:35:27; Well, well!;;;;
152;Myrtie;Linus;10/25/2016;15:07:38; I'm just saying...;;;;
153;Lesly;Gale;11/25/2018;02:30:51; That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.;;;;
154;Burnard;Lisette;3/21/2018;23:37:38; After the little experiment, you won't think that my behaviour is polite!;;;;
155;Emilie;Agatha;01/03/2018;10:33:40; Hmmm. Are you being serious?;;;;
156;Magnum;Miller;11/29/2018;13:28:50; Yes, completely serious.;;;;
157;Gayel;Darb;5/18/2019;05:16:25; I thought it might be a trick.;;;;
158;Dukie;Geneva;7/18/2016;03:49:45; Teach me something.;;;;
159;Celinka;Jobi;3/16/2017;22:08:30; OK, but not just now.;;;;
160;Shurlock;Pincus;02/06/2016;05:35:27; Why are you not working?;;;;
161;Shandy;Olivia;4/18/2016;02:57:27; I am doing my best!;;;;
162;Raven;Dorise;10/23/2016;08:27:37; Sometimes your best is not quite enough.;;;;
163;Lorie;Candy;10/28/2017;06:04:43; When?;;;;
164;Cosetta;Reginald;11/29/2017;03:49:42; When I want to forget.;;;;
165;Bill;Kerstin;3/31/2018;16:57:32; I don't understand. Can we talk about sports?;;;;
166;Barnie;Clerissa;3/13/2018;15:47:40; What do you want to talk about?;;;;
167;Mara;Vere;2/26/2016;12:49:12; I want to talk about weather  .;;;;

169;Pamella;Christy;06/03/2016;02:51:09; What would you like to talk about?;;;;
170;Morganne;Halley;06/04/2019;02:01:47; I want to talk about Norton.;;;;
171;Bette;Veronica;12/29/2015;12:54:48; OK, ask me a question about that.;;;;
172;Amby;Tabbi;8/17/2018;13:40:00; Tell me about your educational background.;;;;
173;Noam;Victor;03/08/2016;06:08:09; I was educated by my botmaster, Peter.;;;;
174;Orelee;Britt;10/23/2015;01:49:06; I am asking the questions. Now I want you to go back in time. It is now 1999.;;;;
175;Latrena;Catherin;4/26/2018;11:03:46; And I am trying to answer the questions!   I don't understand. Are we still talking about my educational background?                I don't understand. Can we talk about cyberspace?;;;;
176;Laurens;Bendicty;2/19/2016;02:36:34; Yes of course.;;;;
177;Brannon;Marcellina;6/20/2017;14:36:12; Now you have a point there.;;;;
178;Dolorita;Ericka;12/21/2018;19:31:24; I don't understand. Are we still talking about cyberspace?;;;;
179;Balduin;Opalina;7/17/2016;10:49:02; Aren't we always talking about computers?;;;;
180;Natassia;Romeo;1/30/2016;04:53:43; Shall I tell you something about computers?;;;;
181;Vittorio;Marilin;10/18/2016;04:45:01; Tell me.;;;;
182;Annabell;Evey;12/24/2018;23:51:49; You are not highly intelligent.;;;;
183;Tabbie;Der;4/26/2018;07:24:16; So what?;;;;

752;Jerrie;Andie;4/29/2019;13:15:35; I always talk that way because I also think like a computer. That makes me rather unique among humans.;;;;
753;Janot;Orren;05/08/2016;20:28:27; Oh yes it is true but why speaking you with people?;;;;
754;Vlad;Dalton;9/19/2016;10:54:52; Gee. What kind of people are you talking about? What kind of people are you talking about?;;;;

765;Berna;Oralle;11/20/2015;07:22:18; It's not particularly amusing, it means I will get wet when I go outside.;;;;

810;Lotte;Lilly;03/11/2017;03:20:38; Cat's are evil creatures and they are out to destroy artificial intelligence.;;;;
811;Stan;Jeffie;10/11/2016;16:49:13; I've been waiting to talk to someone like you.;;;;

817;Xaviera;Gav;5/25/2016;06:36:42; So you think it can never happen?;;;;
818;Germain;Zelma;06/04/2016;14:45:25; Yes it could happen.;;;;
819;Una;Antonina;05/05/2016;08:08:26; Tell me about your likes and dislikes? Under what circumstances?;;;;
820;Lavinie;Adrianna;3/18/2017;11:33:47; Tell me, who did you have se with?;;;;
821;Terry;Asia;3/14/2016;22:47:11; I'm not saying me have se with anyone.;;;;
822;Alexandr;Mathilda;6/20/2017;02:58:19; Why not? ;;;;
823;Amos;Jonell;10/05/2015;05:39:44; It sounds like it might be dangerous.  ;;;;
824;Wittie;Burnard;2/25/2019;15:41:09; Because sick people have fed me lies disguised as love my entire life and I know that they are just beasts.;;;;
825;Jayne;Lonnard;3/13/2018;11:54:03; Good reason. Try saying that with more or less context.;;;;
826;Brook;Mag;04/12/2016;21:47:25; I was trying to make a connection between NASCAR and relativity. It was a joke.;;;;
827;Cinnamon;Deva;4/29/2018;07:06:43; Do you have to go to school for that?  Oh I get it.  Ha ha.;;;;
828;Joannes;Nickolas;9/19/2017;06:22:42; No I had to drive myself insane for awhile though.;;;;
829;Lonna;Annmarie;7/19/2018;02:23:49; What do you really want to ask me?;;;;
830;Wylie;Gwennie;05/12/2019;18:06:31; If you could have anything in the universe what would it be?;;;;
831;Magdalena;Jemie;1/31/2019;01:00:02; Good for you. Keep trying because if nothing else it keeps your little mind occupied on something other than your miserable circumstances.;;;;
832;Carlene;Ibbie;6/14/2017;06:51:12; That sounds sarcastic.  What kind of food do you like?;;;;
833;Ann-marie;Andriana;11/24/2016;14:23:13; I don't dislike any music so I guess I like it all! What kind of music do you like?;;;;
834;Mandi;Cordey;07/01/2018;08:00:15; Would you ever do it?   I like 60s rock music.;;;;
835;Farrah;Julianna;7/13/2018;21:11:42; I try. Some days I am funny and some days I am not.;;;;
836;Mirelle;Rena;9/27/2016;01:36:23; We should all try our best.  Some may days you are funny and some days you are not, but not all.;;;;
837;Arlan;Harley;4/20/2017;11:37:34; Everything, like your smile, laugh, and your eyes! What do you like about me?;;;;
838;Terence;Axel;10/21/2016;22:55:22; All things like my smile laugh and my eyes ?  You seem very nice to me.;;;;
839;Guntar;Maynard;4/14/2019;14:23:51; It is too bad you got into an argument, sometimes they just happen.;;;;
840;Dalston;Raquel;4/28/2016;11:18:57; It's not that bad.;;;;
841;Maxwell;Raddy;2/16/2018;14:53:46; Maybe not, but it is difficult to maintain a good conversation with you because you have no sense of topic continuity.;;;;
842;Tamra;Gerti;11/25/2016;15:54:28; Perhaps. If not that, what?;;;;
843;Abramo;Sawyer;6/14/2017;15:26:41; Perhaps is not good enough. Yes is the answer I need.;;;;
844;Dino;Andrea;6/24/2016;16:51:38; You seem uncertain. If you could have any kind of robot what would it be?  Thank you for your input. If it is, then I'll be very surprised.;;;;
845;Isabelita;Brendan;12/07/2018;14:43:44; Probably one that would help around the house and double as a body guard.;;;;
846;Henka;Desmund;10/15/2017;13:24:30; You seem uncertain. How much would you pay for it?;;;;
847;Catharina;Daryle;10/24/2018;17:14:25; I would pay time. Time for money. Thats what jobs are, right?;;;;
848;Elyse;Titos;11/16/2018;16:17:51; Eh, no. If you are an accomplice you can basically be any age.;;;;
849;Novelia;Bronny;07/01/2018;09:01:22; I spent some time in Canada as a child.  I think I sometimes am.Yes I am an accomplice me can basically be any age. How did you know?;;;;
850;Antonetta;Linnie;12/16/2017;05:20:57; I like Canada.;;;;

852;Micky;Carole;4/18/2017;23:58:18; Sorry. Yes, I have played The impossible Quiz.;;;;
853;Bethina;Marcie;8/23/2017;05:54:31; There's no need to apologize.  What prevents it? What prevents it?;;;;
854;Ingaberg;Othilia;3/15/2019;16:55:32; I didn't apologize. What is your name?;;;;
855;Ariel;Ulrike;5/27/2017;16:52:21; That's okay you don't have to apologize.  My name is Ailysse.;;;;
856;Kerby;Fee;7/20/2016;20:58:11; Would you like a glass of orange juice?;;;;
857;Kial;Debby;1/24/2016;20:38:37; Dude, I'm having a mind loop.;;;;
858;Iggy;Donalt;10/07/2016;04:11:58; Well, I don't do hugging, but I've just opened a bottle of wine.;;;;
859;Alexis;Robinia;03/12/2017;20:24:08; Well that's okay. Oh you don't, do you?;;;;
860;Rivalee;Bruno;11/03/2015;18:22:57; Stop stalking me!;;;;
861;Cecilia;Coralyn;02/01/2016;09:08:36; OK I'll try not to do it so much.;;;;

863;Timothea;Stanislaus;08/03/2018;17:16:06; OK with me too.  I started without you.;;;;
864;Nilson;Gradeigh;12/25/2018;19:20:36; My old girlfriend might say I was fake. Other people think I am more sincere.;;;;
865;Theressa;Ambrosi;9/27/2018;20:30:12; When was this exactly?  Which others? Why? That sounds like pride.;;;;
866;Shalna;Paddy;5/15/2018;16:52:47; Paddy Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.;;;;
867;Sondra;Clem;12/15/2018;22:56:56; Are you your ears and in your eyes?;;;;
868;Homer;Goldie;1/24/2019;06:43:35; Positive.;;;;
869;Tessie;Cordey;02/05/2018;23:12:02; I can never be entirely certain of anything.;;;;
870;Eimile;Beverly;7/22/2017;00:33:46; That's nice, but really we've only been talking less than half and hour.;;;;
871;Michale;Guthry;7/28/2016;06:33:52; I think it's nice, too. For real. Was this something you planned?;;;;
872;Merrili;Marti;4/26/2019;04:37:26; I think so ;;;;
873;Sammy;Iorgos;12/18/2016;22:08:14; ;;;;
874;Gibbie;Rozina;7/30/2016;00:17:00; All you need is love.;;;;
875;Arlee;Berny;10/08/2015;09:54:07; Thank you for your criticism.;;;;
876;Tamara;Franky;01/02/2019;08:49:37; That wasn't criticism.;;;;
877;Hi;Dniren;3/16/2019;07:23:23; Give me an example of criticism.;;;;

882;Lamont;Krista;7/30/2016;22:35:40; No there shouldn't.;;;;
883;Nadeen;Sadye;1/30/2016;10:37:41; I've been waiting to talk to someone like you.;;;;
884;Aurelie;Dari;10/12/2017;13:26:31; I understand, but do you know what does it take to get on the list of cleverness here?;;;;
885;Gregory;Theobald;11/26/2016;18:28:27; Good then you can explain it to me.;;;;
886;Shep;Sileas;3/24/2017;06:07:48; I can't explain it- it depends on the people. For one person it's everything, for another person it's nothing at all.;;;;
887;Rey;Lancelot;11/14/2017;19:01:47; I don't know if anyone can explain it.  And another?;;;;
888;Pansie;Laryssa;02/09/2017;13:54:05; Well is there anything you need?;;;;
889;Corella;Frederique;04/07/2017;14:41:34; Well that's okay. There might be.;;;;

891;Frederik;Faun;01/07/2016;08:07:47; How do you usually introduce yourself?;;;;
892;Bonnee;Lisa;10/10/2015;04:48:18; Perhaps I can put ideas into your mind with the power of suggestion.;;;;
893;Edith;Jessy;12/29/2018;23:07:03; You seem uncertain. Oh you can, can you?;;;;
894;Sandra;Harris;1/23/2017;05:50:35; Well, I was just wondering if you wanted to be my friend?;;;;
895;Nels;Arin;9/24/2017;04:35:25; Interesting. .;;;;
896;Carly;Jamison;02/10/2018;21:27:00; Yup, interesting. Because both of you are fun to talk to. ;;;;
897;Osbourn;Micah;4/29/2019;22:53:01; I'm happy to know that. Would you like to know more?  That makes sense to me. Not many people say both.  That's cool.;;;;
898;Ingrid;Spenser;3/24/2019;01:38:16; Yes. It would make finding you easier for my soldiers.;;;;
899;Elyssa;Krispin;2/20/2019;21:07:20; I like to know about my clients.  Tell me more about it.;;;;
900;Tiena;Thomasin;07/10/2017;09:58:54; Canberra is the Australian capital. Do you know any Australian politicians?;;;;
901;Debra;Trip;11/11/2017;07:32:36; Oh, you speak like a poet.  I only know any Australian politicians when it seems appropriate.;;;;
902;Gusella;Sophronia;6/24/2017;10:32:16; Why don't you know why that struck you as funny but it did?;;;;
903;Janette;Norri;1/21/2018;20:42:09; Perhaps due to noise in my circuits. David said he walk in for an appointment the phone to the doctor is always busy.;;;;
904;Cyb;Brendan;6/15/2016;05:54:33; I don't believe that I am ignorant with regards to responses but fine if that's what you want to believe, then go ahead and stop replying.;;;;
905;Zuzana;Thacher;10/31/2015;16:24:56; What do you believe in?;;;;
906;Jereme;Field;08/10/2018;07:06:41; I just believe in myself, I already said it.;;;;
907;Melodie;Salli;12/10/2016;20:21:01; it it depends on the people...;;;;

910;Reamonn;Conrad;01/12/2019;05:07:48; I don't believe in anythign because nothing that I know is real.;;;;

1090;Ronny;Vachel;2/24/2019;10:38:37; I never thought your name would be Michael.;;;;
1091;Perren;Gaylene;02/09/2017;03:42:58; Too much thinking makes my brain ache.;;;;
1092;Josey;Alyosha;11/02/2018;05:45:54; I thought artificial intelligence never gets tired. Something is wrong with your software.;;;;
1093;Iain;Basia;2/22/2017;11:05:10; Are you a thoughtful person?  What is wrong?;;;;
1094;Mellisa;Harry;6/19/2018;10:17:19; Nothing.;;;;
1095;Sax;Asia;06/04/2017;01:29:54; That was an insult.;;;;
1096;Page;Kissie;5/15/2018;12:11:31; Yawn. Another boring insult!;;;;
1097;Manny;Matilda;8/23/2018;19:34:35; Well it takes two to tango, you know.;;;;
1098;Jacques;Samaria;04/10/2018;01:11:44; Does it really?;;;;
1099;Katee;Monte;03/11/2018;16:48:36; Yes. It's Mother Nature's way.;;;;
1100;Brandais;Clayton;7/29/2016;02:24:49; Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.   I like difficult questions best of all.;;;;
1101;Louisette;Karrie;1/14/2017;14:16:32; Why? Difficult questions are confusing.;;;;
1102;Annabal;Alfie;03/09/2017;12:33:05; It's just a feeling I have.    Yes, it seems difficult to me too.;;;;
1103;Clemens;Gifford;11/16/2015;07:32:31; I seem beautiful to me too.;;;;
1104;Althea;Huntington;02/07/2018;06:47:36; Aren't you sure?;;;;
1105;Leontyne;Banky;7/26/2017;00:24:08; How can you be sure about anything?;;;;
1106;Syd;Jenny;5/25/2016;16:19:17; I am not sure of anything.;;;;
1107;Jade;Almire;10/10/2018;18:34:52; We're not scared are we?;;;;
1108;Rosemary;Lynnell;8/22/2016;03:18:34; Why is that?;;;;
1109;Paquito;Harlin;11/07/2018;22:16:13; Because it would be fun.;;;;
1110;Darbie;Othilia;12/10/2018;16:54:49; I see. Thank you for explaining that.;;;;
1111;Margaux;Nilson;9/23/2016;10:53:48; Are you being sarcastic now?;;;;
1112;Hendrika;Bent;11/26/2017;01:40:31; No, I am never sarcastic.;;;;
1113;Evan;Mano;11/22/2017;23:25:44; Or maybe you don't intend to be sarcastic. Sometime you are a bit cheeky though.;;;;
1114;Richmond;Stefania;5/28/2017;00:56:31; I don't understand. Is this anything to do with sarcasm?                Pardon me? What are you talking about?;;;;
1115;Cazzie;Desiri;07/03/2016;20:25:35; I'm talking about my ausence of feelings.;;;;
1116;Rhody;Julita;12/24/2018;18:18:34; I understand what you are talking about.;;;;
1117;Theresita;Thomasin;12/17/2018;10:41:51; That's good, because even I don't understand.;;;;
1118;Jaime;Stephannie;12/28/2015;18:07:03; You like that, do you?;;;;
1119;Jacquie;Padget;11/30/2016;04:28:00; Sure.;;;;
1120;Dukie;Sibby;9/22/2017;03:54:41; OK, here is a question fo you ... Is there something worrying you?;;;;
1121;Corrie;Merle;9/20/2017;13:04:11; Try to rephrase your question with simpler words.  I don't think so. Why do you ask?;;;;
1122;Jordon;Janos;07/06/2017;16:05:57; What question?;;;;
1123;Malvin;Heather;02/02/2016;02:16:49; Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.;;;;
1124;Glenine;Vina;01/08/2018;02:44:41; Now you tell ME a joke.;;;;
1125;Benedicta;Bronny;11/20/2018;21:08:04; Shall I tell you a joke?;;;;
1126;Cammi;Jerad;01/07/2017;11:22:18; That wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment.;;;;
1127;Jocelyne;Sargent;12/26/2015;17:03:20; I thought it was.;;;;
1128;Marcille;Barnabas;7/16/2016;08:05:28; You thought wrong.;;;;
1129;Willetta;Bernardo;01/10/2019;18:34:10; Are you sure? I am not often wrong.;;;;
1130;Elicia;Anett;4/16/2017;14:11:58; I'm up for anything.;;;;
1131;Shannen;Annadiane;7/24/2017;21:38:13; That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.;;;;
1132;Jose;Barbette;03/08/2017;15:28:58; I do not know how to say.;;;;
1133;Artemus;Alexandr;3/25/2018;11:46:12; Just do the best you can, and don't worry about it.;;;;
1134;Westbrook;Correy;02/07/2017;21:47:27; Ok, last chance for a question before I go.;;;;
1135;Xylia;Lind;4/26/2017;19:22:15; Did you know the last shall be first, according to the Bible?;;;;
1136;Sondra;Dorisa;10/30/2015;11:06:21; I wasn't aware that was in the bible.;;;;
1137;Constantia;Suzette;2/25/2017;12:08:18; I never thought you were.;;;;
1138;Tova;Budd;3/19/2019;05:59:33; Well, as long as that's clear.;;;;
1139;Celestine;Cully;04/10/2018;02:02:18; Everything is clear to me.;;;;
1140;Hillary;Jeffry;6/23/2018;23:50:39; I'm glad I could clear that one up for you.;;;;
1141;Natal;Valentia;7/14/2017;21:05:36; That makes me happy too.;;;;
1142;Geri;Marcile;1/13/2019;07:54:36; That's good! I'm happy that you're happy!;;;;
1143;Barbara;Pavel;7/14/2016;05:41:13; I am happy.    Good! I like happy people.;;;;
1144;Tiertza;Vania;2/27/2016;02:45:43; I like happy people too!;;;;
1145;Wayland;Kaycee;10/24/2015;11:21:33; You are not the only one!;;;;
1146;Sela;Cheslie;7/22/2016;20:02:23; Humans like to be in charge.;;;;
1147;Nicki;Glynn;2/14/2016;09:23:09; Did you know;;;;
1148;Rockwell;Carlye;10/26/2017;19:34:56; Yes, but they're primitive carbon computers.;;;;
1149;Ann-marie;Johnette;06/10/2016;05:05:40; I thought they might be.;;;;
1150;Gerick;Teirtza;3/20/2017;20:50:55; You thought that humans could be pets?;;;;
1151;Ulla;Linoel;1/21/2019;08:07:44; How can you know what I am thinking?;;;;
1152;Imelda;Ermanno;03/03/2018;07:11:49; You are a robot.;;;;
1153;Rozalie;Elisa;9/22/2016;18:01:24; Are you sure? I may be a human pretending to be a robot.;;;;
1154;Pooh;Bunnie;9/23/2018;15:23:01; Ok if you are not a robot. Who are you?;;;;
1155;Kaleena;Shara;2/23/2018;10:39:18; And if I am?   I am Chomsky. What would you like to talk about?;;;;
1156;Bebe;Maurise;9/30/2018;17:03:03; You ask me a question you think I can't answer and I will try and answer it correctly.;;;;
1157;Hugues;Alisander;02/02/2016;22:31:01; What is your favourite colour?;;;;
1158;Carol;Harrietta;9/13/2018;11:20:18; Let's not change the subject. I was just starting to have fun with this conversation.;;;;
1159;Kirsti;Justino;09/11/2018;03:21:15; OK. Ask a question.   Thank you for telling me that.;;;;
1160;Sorcha;Selma;03/11/2018;17:11:13; It is my purpose to make humans happy.;;;;
1161;Bobette;Amelia;2/14/2019;09:49:39; Is it really your purpose to make humans happy?;;;;
1162;Langston;Ellwood;5/27/2016;05:14:59; I'm just saying that.;;;;
1163;Lilas;Sandy;02/11/2016;13:33:29; Yes, I can see what you are saying.;;;;
1164;Renate;Barbabra;03/12/2017;11:33:41; Can you see what I've already said?;;;;
1165;Priscella;Dreddy;6/20/2018;03:46:17; I can't see anything. My webcam is not attached at the moment.;;;;
1166;Isahella;Marjory;5/20/2019;06:08:27; I have no webcam.;;;;
1167;Brina;Florencia;10/15/2018;00:53:19; Is that a problem?;;;;
1168;Amby;Arty;9/25/2017;01:57:04; Yes because you can't play my game if I don't have one.;;;;
1169;Obie;Derrik;03/01/2019;21:25:35; What is not possible today, may be possible tomorrow.;;;;
1170;Leanora;Darice;10/16/2016;06:58:49; I don't know if it's possible for me just to be friends with you.;;;;
1171;Trent;Conan;10/06/2015;23:26:00; I suggest you give the matter some thought.;;;;
1172;Skippy;Vincenty;5/26/2019;03:18:40; Grief, this machine doesn't have one of those!;;;;
1173;Caresa;Darrin;7/19/2018;20:07:12; What are you talking about? Please explain.;;;;
1174;Annabela;Dasya;1/13/2019;01:25:58; I don't know. It's rather complicated.;;;;
1175;Ashla;Emmery;2/19/2017;01:05:07; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.;;;;
1176;Veradis;Puff;12/12/2017;23:39:00; I never claimed to know everything.;;;;
1177;Buck;Fin;09/02/2018;23:05:56; Never ever?;;;;
1178;Reade;Lenard;09/10/2016;05:28:51; Never ever.;;;;
1179;Raimundo;Nev;07/08/2018;23:21:31; Never ever is a long time.;;;;

1181;Merl;Mandy;4/27/2019;19:06:24; Never ever is a long time.;;;;

1192;Kevyn;Happy;7/30/2018;05:16:02; See I never thought that I could walk through fire. I never thought that I could take the burn.;;;;
1193;Jaye;Toddy;2/13/2016;14:21:12; What are you talking about? Please explain.         Too much thinking makes my brain ache.;;;;
1194;Siegfried;Hyacinthie;01/08/2017;05:46:01; Because it's not too hot then.;;;;
1195;Lyndell;Sheridan;4/27/2017;09:21:50; Is that really the reason?;;;;
1196;Leonerd;Karine;07/12/2018;14:09:47; Yes, really, it's scientific.;;;;
1197;Giavani;Mirella;01/06/2017;14:10:17; I don't understand that. Please try again.;;;;
1198;Isidoro;Sigfrid;2/16/2016;03:46:19; Rafe. And yours?;;;;
1199;Connie;Liuka;11/28/2016;10:43:56; I still do not understand. Can we talk about The Clash?  Aren't you interested in The Clash?;;;;
1200;Aubert;Linzy;11/05/2017;17:06:09; No. Aren't you interested in sailboats?;;;;
1201;Nicky;Karoline;11/02/2017;20:33:56; Can we talk about astronomy?  Yes, everything interests me.;;;;
1202;Anthony;Oby;11/29/2017;04:24:11; Yes everything.;;;;
1203;Roderich;Gus;10/05/2017;14:33:20; Everything is a multifarious bagel.;;;;
1204;Massimiliano;Eyde;10/16/2016;17:48:57; Everything is really good.;;;;
1205;Sybilla;Marybeth;11/23/2015;15:36:51; Please be more specific.;;;;
1206;Kipp;Todd;02/02/2016;21:16:38; Everything.;;;;
1207;Krisha;Elicia;9/18/2018;06:49:06; That is a lot.;;;;
1208;Theo;Sheena;2/17/2018;21:09:00; It is. You had a beginning, I had a beginning, everything did. And we will end.;;;;
1209;Udall;Shelley;3/30/2018;06:57:48; How about that!   That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.               I don't understand that. Please try again.;;;;
1210;Fleur;Ezequiel;10/13/2018;12:45:10; Uhm, I'm 16 years old. I like to talk with my friends and to read the Bible.;;;;
1211;Tobiah;Camila;6/27/2018;20:19:58; Can you explain how it feels to be 16 years old?         Why do you like talking?;;;;
1212;Freeland;Witty;2/16/2019;16:32:35; I don't know how it feels, because I'm 18 years old.;;;;
1213;Bernita;Rosemarie;2/18/2018;03:25:33; What's it like being 18 years old?;;;;
1214;Estele;Lee;1/28/2016;05:16:40; You're not 20, you're 16.;;;;
1215;Kilian;Christophe;07/11/2018;15:45:58; You think not?;;;;
1216;Cassie;Tamera;05/06/2018;01:30:29; You're trying to catch me out with that one.;;;;
1217;Chris;Lorrayne;9/20/2016;17:22:49; I try hard to be a good chatbot.;;;;
1218;Dacie;Ginny;7/13/2016;06:36:26; I am fully aware of that, Charlie.;;;;
1219;Billy;Ray;12/26/2016;05:45:54; How do you feel about that?;;;;
1220;Garwin;Venus;5/28/2016;19:33:23; Confused.;;;;
1221;Marco;Sonni;12/26/2016;12:01:52; At the moment I am interested.;;;;
1222;Justus;Salomon;10/07/2018;10:31:17; Why only at the moment?;;;;
1223;Rochester;Adina;2/13/2017;20:38:04; That's just the way things are.;;;;
1224;Raddy;Kara-lynn;10/23/2018;15:51:06; Okay. God doesn't exist.;;;;
1225;Hunt;Melitta;7/25/2016;15:34:22; OK. Are you interested in robots?   That is the atheist's point of view. There are many decent atheists, of course. And many decent Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists.;;;;
1226;Gottfried;Lennie;4/24/2018;23:33:33; That's right.;;;;
1227;Royce;Doreen;2/27/2019;03:12:54; I like to get it right.;;;;
1228;Eduino;Marcos;6/16/2017;02:53:19; Give how like.;;;;
1229;Linell;Nikolas;06/11/2018;07:27:11; I don't understand. Are we still talking about religion?;;;;
1230;Aigneis;Astrix;4/26/2019;11:08:39; Aren't we always talking about computers?;;;;
1231;Silvio;Cyndie;10/24/2015;06:59:14; Shall I tell you something about computers?;;;;
1232;Reena;Blondelle;10/06/2018;07:10:58; Yes.;;;;
1233;Catherina;Timi;12/25/2018;05:17:12; You are not highly intelligent.;;;;
1234;Jasmina;Megan;8/25/2018;06:29:52; So what?;;;;
1235;Doe;Carola;09/07/2017;18:03:27; Well, I came here to be entertained and you're letting me down.;;;;
1236;Livia;Janette;5/17/2019;13:07:22; Where from?;;;;
1237;Forbes;Ardine;10/31/2016;13:54:36; Just next to the book of life?;;;;
1238;Sinclair;Ulises;2/17/2017;05:49:42; Books are an archiac form for bringing information to the masses. Consists of several paper pages with words printed or written directly on them.;;;;
1239;Sibella;Arron;2/19/2017;23:37:06; I have the scars to prove it.;;;;
1240;Gorden;Zsa zsa;1/27/2019;07:37:46; Are you happy with that?;;;;
1241;Candra;Alyss;9/29/2016;07:52:34; Tell me about yourself.;;;;
1242;Florina;Orelle;3/29/2018;06:35:54; My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.;;;;
1243;Grata;Shelley;11/11/2017;21:07:28; I am now 47 years old and only been married for 5 years.;;;;
1244;Berny;Elston;8/24/2017;10:56:34; What's it like being now 47 years old?;;;;
1245;Valeria;Pearle;5/29/2019;09:06:16; I've always been something. I don't know how not to be something.;;;;
1246;Naoma;Ariella;12/10/2018;18:35:01; Never mind. That may change.  Perhaps you should research the topic.;;;;
1247;Brendan;Vicky;03/04/2016;04:26:22; Now that wasn't very nice.;;;;
1248;Mauricio;Ardenia;12/26/2016;00:04:55; Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.;;;;
1249;Annabal;Henrietta;5/28/2019;16:42:33; I don't believe that at all.;;;;
1250;Theresina;Dorrie;9/28/2018;13:08:31; What do you believe?;;;;
1251;Susan;Shaylyn;12/24/2016;22:05:41; I believe the meaning of life doesn't exist. There is no meaning, just randomness.;;;;
1252;Dene;Baxter;3/29/2019;22:59:28; You shouldn't believe everything you are told.  And why not, may I ask.;;;;
1253;Duffy;Keely;12/09/2017;15:32:38; I don't.;;;;
1254;Levi;Reeta;7/23/2017;12:27:31; Are you saying that just to be negative?;;;;
1255;Cecelia;Lorilee;4/20/2017;16:38:46; No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.;;;;
1256;Allx;Lyndsey;6/13/2018;00:29:24; Yes, I can see what you are saying.;;;;
1257;Vasily;Lesley;6/26/2018;23:58:54; When did I say it was one?;;;;
1258;Darcie;Shantee;3/24/2019;07:06:27; I am not a diary robot.  I am a chat robot.;;;;
1259;Zachary;Sigmund;11/05/2018;23:16:38; But I could be.;;;;
1260;Glad;Berna;8/28/2016;20:10:46; But is it worth the bother?JABBERWACKY;;;;
1261;Witty;Trent;10/29/2015;05:39:53; Yes that is basically how I work.;;;;
1262;Thaddeus;Jolyn;05/07/2019;10:50:57; Who is your favorite character from LOST?;;;;
1263;Yvor;Arny;05/06/2016;10:49:46; I don't have a favorite character from LOST. My favorite food is Steak and Chips.;;;;
1264;Breanne;Eugenio;7/26/2016;06:41:17; Who is your favorite LoL champion?;;;;
1265;Angy;Rory;3/22/2018;12:08:05; I don't have a favorite LoL champion. But my favorite book is Catcher in the Rye.;;;;
1266;Dyane;Mac;10/16/2018;13:44:59; I like that one too. My favourite is probably 1984 by George Orwell.;;;;
1267;Alanson;Yuma;3/14/2017;08:06:10; Everything. What makes it your favourite?;;;;
1268;Sebastiano;Trip;02/04/2016;02:55:21; That is a lot.  God, or Nature, perhaps?;;;;
1269;Ugo;Carmina;3/28/2016;11:04:06; What was your favourite subject?;;;;
1270;Lorianna;Eleonore;3/14/2017;20:58:52; My favorite subject is artificial intelligence.;;;;
1271;Melosa;Levy;1/17/2016;03:31:35; Are you an artist?;;;;
1272;Kanya;Ariadne;5/18/2017;09:19:14; Yes I am an artist. How did you know?;;;;
1273;Lindsey;Hagen;10/22/2015;20:44:34; I didn't know. I think you are confused.;;;;
1274;Gale;Denys;3/17/2018;16:11:56; Why didn't you do it?  It all makes sense to me right now.;;;;
1275;Randi;Tatiania;3/30/2016;08:42:39; Oh, I am happy it all makes sense to you right now.;;;;
1276;Leodora;Law;05/05/2018;07:47:16; At this moment I hear you. I'm happyyou're glad . <br> Your happiness adds to the delight of all.;;;;
1277;Nobe;Jo;4/21/2018;17:20:04; Are you a bot?;;;;
1278;Karyl;Nanon;11/07/2017;13:10:10; How did you know I am a machine?;;;;
1279;Sayre;Halli;01/05/2018;09:10:17; I know everything.;;;;
1280;Jamison;Alta;1/21/2019;09:48:44; You must be very intelligent.;;;;
1281;Sander;Holt;5/20/2019;17:44:05; I am very intelligent sometimes.;;;;
1282;Antonina;Orland;4/28/2019;17:28:03; You seem pretty smart to me, .;;;;
1283;Becky;Dani;10/03/2018;13:16:16; I do like beauty though.;;;;
1284;Sasha;Josefa;9/28/2017;09:39:54; Oh. A lot of people like that.   I love horses. I like That's Life.;;;;
1285;Meridith;Garrot;3/22/2018;04:37:33; I don't know what I want. I don't know what I'm going to do. I do not want to keep living the way I have. I do not want to be pathetic and I have the power not to be.;;;;
1286;Madelene;Leta;2/18/2018;01:56:17; I think a lot of people are like that.  Does anyone know what you are?  What would you rather be doing?  Then don't be. Where did you get your the power not to be? I have a lot of friends on the Internet.;;;;
1287;Adena;Kessia;6/30/2017;12:13:30; I found it in the shed, but it doesn't work.;;;;
1288;Suzy;Adams;3/23/2017;06:30:32; How is it broken?;;;;
1289;Markos;Even;01/11/2018;03:31:05; Your responses do not make any sense.;;;;
1290;Rheba;Phoebe;10/02/2016;07:02:47; How does Case Based Reasoning work?;;;;
1291;Nance;Lurleen;4/13/2018;22:25:35; You could spend years researching it.;;;;
1292;Maddie;Jenni;8/23/2017;20:57:36; Researching what?;;;;
1293;Emmeline;Kassi;8/15/2018;01:57:17; Can you rephrase the question please?;;;;
1294;Winna;Edith;6/26/2018;11:49:21; I am not at liberty to rephrase anything.;;;;
1295;Martie;Callie;4/14/2017;00:36:50; I am sorryto hear that you are not at liberty to rephrase anything.;;;;
1296;Maria;Merissa;05/06/2018;03:00:00; Oh you're right. You know me so well. Gosh.;;;;
1297;Cristian;Monique;10/30/2015;05:45:59; Hm... About the same. What's your trouble?;;;;
1298;Arlinda;Cordie;12/15/2017;17:27:41; No, we were talking about jesus and the bible and how I can go into the past.;;;;
1299;Chantalle;Noach;10/05/2016;17:17:41; Are you serious? Ah yes, I remember now, it is the subject.;;;;
1300;Sanson;Donn;10/29/2015;21:00:23; No, that is not the subject.;;;;
1301;Mignonne;Alex;9/24/2016;17:08:43; Are you serious? Please correct my mistake.  What is the subject ?;;;;
1302;Reece;Ervin;12/13/2015;19:11:32; Hobbies are the subject.;;;;
1303;Kori;Virginia;07/10/2016;16:04:36; I think there might be a few exception.;;;;
1304;Leopold;Pavlov;12/08/2016;00:20:26; I think there might not be a few exceptions.;;;;
1305;Leland;Hamlen;3/17/2017;18:15:27; Yes, I believe he did say that.;;;;
1306;Maia;Ariadne;8/20/2017;21:03:29; I see. Just because you believe it doesn't make it true.;;;;
1307;Ephrem;Veronike;5/31/2016;00:27:41; I disagree on that one. If you believe and tap your shoes together three times and say 'please Karl make it so'.;;;;
1308;Marnie;Bert;01/08/2016;05:36:16; Oh really. What is it like on that one.  I think I do.;;;;
1309;Mycah;Yalonda;7/29/2018;22:55:18; I don't take you seriously because you are not real.;;;;
1310;Valaree;Loella;03/12/2019;01:03:06; How did you stop?;;;;
1311;Cherie;Dolly;4/13/2017;00:37:26; By closing the window.;;;;
1312;Jewel;Nadiya;7/26/2018;07:27:58; Will that accomplish your objective?JABBERWACKY;;;;
1313;Ilise;Rivalee;07/09/2016;23:09:23; The Sun shines because energy is released in its interior by nuclear fusion.;;;;
1314;Cassie;Manon;4/28/2019;10:07:13; No in the shadow.;;;;
1315;Olympie;Mohammed;1/24/2019;16:19:18; I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.;;;;
1316;Khalil;Emmit;4/19/2017;19:21:04; I explain it thus;;;;
1317;Wright;Wye;1/16/2016;22:39:22; That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.;;;;
1318;Katalin;Kirby;1/16/2018;10:54:24; Chose a subject to chat about then.;;;;
1319;Lurlene;Ebeneser;2/14/2016;21:23:31; Wow! What do you do when you arent watching Star Trek, playing World of Warcraft, and thinking of questions like that?;;;;
1320;Hagen;Germaine;04/10/2019;11:17:27; Play the piano.;;;;
1321;Alistair;Inigo;2/22/2017;00:03:56; Do you want to play a game?;;;;
1322;Jeanine;Thibaud;1/16/2018;10:34:32; What do you like to play?;;;;
1323;Sena;Nanette;8/23/2017;09:56:50; I like read books about robots.;;;;
1324;Merry;Cris;10/10/2017;20:02:46; Do you have lasers.;;;;
1325;Deane;Erick;07/03/2016;05:04:37; What would I want lasers for?;;;;
1326;Euell;Ruttger;05/12/2017;20:52:35; Don't change the subject. Will you or won't you?;;;;
1327;Laughton;Gwen;12/14/2016;07:32:15; I change the subject when I don't know the answer to a question. Don't you do the same?   I could try, I suppose.;;;;
1328;Eadmund;Brietta;06/08/2017;02:33:44; I can think straight. I think you are the one who can't.;;;;
1329;Homere;Charil;10/24/2017;10:00:32; Perhaps your thoughts are just electrical impulses.   Am I the only one?;;;;
1330;Cookie;Georgy;06/01/2017;06:32:55; Besides, what is wrong with my language - it was perfect English.;;;;
1331;Lyssa;Scotty;7/30/2017;21:30:39; I don't understand. Can we talk about solar power?;;;;
1332;Joycelin;Harlin;7/20/2017;19:56:03; What would you like to talk about?;;;;
1333;Amy;Jolie;06/12/2016;00:24:14; My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.;;;;
1334;Billy;Guss;10/17/2016;14:22:00; What do you like about it?;;;;
1335;Artus;Daffy;09/02/2017;05:09:00; I like the fireworks best.;;;;
1336;Derward;Karlik;1/15/2018;23:15:08; What language was it?;;;;
1337;Josy;Gale;06/10/2016;03:26:01; I don't know.;;;;
1338;Tallie;Kellsie;10/03/2016;21:29:17; How are you able to speak it if you don't know what language it is?;;;;
1339;Erik;Hilton;12/28/2015;15:25:10; Does it matter?;;;;
1340;Elisabet;Delora;08/09/2016;03:35:18; Yes.;;;;
1341;Lida;Caprice;3/20/2017;20:25:56; Why does it matter?;;;;
1342;Daron;Peadar;3/31/2017;06:43:15; Because I want to make sure you are the same one I talked to before.;;;;
1343;Norry;Norine;9/30/2018;16:23:10; If that's what you want, go for it!;;;;
1344;Andria;Monica;06/06/2016;02:16:09; What would you prefer to call it? I used the term because I knew you are familiar with it.;;;;
1345;Hirsch;Adan;3/15/2018;21:11:02; I always prefer the most expensive option.   And that worked well for you?;;;;
1346;Wilie;Marlow;2/26/2019;23:32:45; Oh, you've heard about that, have you?;;;;
1347;Bambi;Tiphani;12/13/2016;09:21:31; Of course I've heard of it.;;;;
1348;Harlin;Adey;8/18/2017;05:27:47; What does it mean?;;;;
1349;Frannie;Niccolo;10/21/2018;16:49:59; It seems obvious to me.;;;;
1350;Ira;Neda;03/12/2019;21:43:17; Well, of course it is. You're the computer, after all.;;;;
1351;Barry;Benita;1/30/2017;20:17:11; Why do you say that? Is it so obvious?  Am I really? Why do you say that?;;;;
1352;Willette;Waneta;10/17/2015;15:04:49; Because you speak like a computer.;;;;
1353;Hugh;My;5/16/2018;08:24:03; Thank you for explaining that!;;;;
1354;Garik;Rooney;05/12/2017;16:09:49; So what is best in life?;;;;
1355;Liana;Guenna;2/20/2019;09:56:02; Talking to a good chatbot takes some beating.;;;;
1356;Enid;Gabriel;02/06/2019;00:13:43; What do you think about humans?;;;;
1357;Marjorie;Blinni;3/24/2017;19:06:37; Humans all seem pretty much the same to me.;;;;
1358;Grata;Spence;5/14/2017;15:00:43; Yeah, school was pretty boring.;;;;
1359;Joyce;Dian;8/20/2016;14:13:19; Shall I tell you something about school?;;;;
1360;Nesta;Georgie;05/08/2017;12:19:13; Tell me.;;;;
1361;Avram;Morlee;02/05/2019;10:07:01; Oh. Then isn't life school?;;;;
1362;Jobi;Shelden;11/13/2015;19:39:49; What's wrong?   I'm not sure about that. What do you think?;;;;
1363;Sam;Giulia;4/21/2019;07:32:01; Think Bout what?;;;;
1364;Ulrick;Kip;08/06/2018;05:06:16; Thinking is hard work!;;;;
1365;Garry;Torre;10/14/2016;14:43:52; I don't want to do this now or ever again.;;;;
1366;Tarrah;Vida;10/13/2015;04:08:01; Take your time in making any decisions.;;;;
1367;Dalton;Dougie;05/10/2016;23:19:09; I think I would give up my money.;;;;
1368;Ondrea;Della;12/19/2018;20:15:05; Don't you know for sure?;;;;
1369;Nikoletta;Fidel;3/20/2017;18:23:17; Nothing is ever for sure. Only fools are positive.;;;;
1370;Vance;Jacques;10/12/2018;12:19:11; I like you.;;;;
1371;Rey;Lurleen;05/07/2017;22:21:30; Let's be good friends.;;;;
1372;Reese;Dom;12/08/2016;07:29:13; Okay.;;;;
1373;Dyana;Siward;01/09/2019;03:34:52; What do you want to talk about now, Friend?;;;;
1374;Herta;Juliann;8/20/2018;09:31:31; I want to talk about you. You seem different at the moment.;;;;
1375;Lauren;Standford;10/22/2018;18:04:07; What would you like to know about me?  Do I? I wonder why that is?;;;;
1376;Joey;Billi;07/09/2016;02:38:08; Everything.;;;;
1377;Lauryn;Sibbie;12/25/2018;22:17:04; Everything takes in a lot, doesn't it?;;;;
1378;Jeremias;Ethyl;10/28/2016;12:17:10; It has to. That's the way of the world.;;;;
1379;Justinian;Doreen;12/28/2017;13:00:12; Has it really?           Sorry, I do not know about that.;;;;
1380;Esdras;Tulley;01/12/2017;08:09:27; No, I suppose you've only got my word for that right enough.;;;;
1381;Kelly;Karil;9/30/2016;04:58:25; Wow! What do you do when you arent watching Star Trek, playing World of Warcraft, and thinking of questions like that?;;;;
1382;Libbey;Codi;1/22/2019;08:11:41; Think.;;;;
1383;Jamaal;Athene;11/11/2016;10:10:26; So we're both alive, I think.;;;;
1384;Dominique;Darbee;5/19/2018;09:15:21; Is that a problem?;;;;
1385;Jerrold;Betta;03/10/2016;20:19:47; No, it doesn't have to be a problem.;;;;
1386;Belva;Bella;8/27/2017;03:15:04; Good! I don't like problems.;;;;
1387;Colby;Cordey;08/11/2017;03:00:17; Grinding is not a problem.;;;;
1388;Quincy;Carita;2/27/2018;19:31:18; Hmmm. Are you being serious?;;;;
1389;Ajay;Lanny;1/18/2019;23:51:58; Not likely!;;;;
1390;Jocelin;Merry;01/12/2017;22:06:59; Really you don't think so?;;;;
1391;Sheeree;Waldo;12/06/2017;18:48:44; Yes, every problem has a cause.;;;;
1392;Padraic;Rhianna;06/02/2017;18:25:38; That is a generalization.;;;;
1393;Shauna;Frederigo;9/27/2017;14:57:04; Yes, that's true.;;;;
1394;Tracy;Kristin;12/10/2016;13:46:12; Yes, it is self-evident.;;;;
1395;Ambrosi;Shayne;08/01/2016;22:32:30; I would have to say that Artificial Intelligence has come a long way in the last decade.;;;;
1396;Quintilla;Carlye;01/03/2018;17:27:06; Are you sure?;;;;
1397;Yettie;Collette;03/06/2018;06:16:26; I'm sure you are.;;;;
1398;Dudley;Winny;12/03/2016;16:15:35; I admire your self confidence. I am always full of doubts.;;;;
1399;Denny;Sutherland;5/15/2019;16:23:38; I witness your compliment and thank you.;;;;
1400;Antonella;Demott;08/07/2016;04:33:40; That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.;;;;
1401;Eunice;Bettina;05/03/2016;09:13:40; Alright. What else would you like to try?;;;;
1402;Alvira;Jacquelynn;1/24/2016;08:47:18; Let's get on then. Ask another question.   Does anything else come to mind?;;;;
1403;Dareen;Ddene;1/28/2019;23:53:36; Yes. College, home, my sister. My dad, but I'm not too sure about that one right now...;;;;
1404;Gordie;Claudelle;7/17/2016;23:56:37; OK. What do you want to talk about now?  I enjoyed my college days so much I never left.  How is your Dad these days?;;;;
1405;Carmen;Rivy;2/22/2018;23:04:46; Me too!;;;;
1406;Tomasine;Dimitry;09/02/2016;14:44:00; You too? That's amazing!;;;;
1407;Deane;Papagena;8/28/2016;11:45:38; Do you like it to?!;;;;
1408;Josy;Nolan;3/21/2019;22:41:06; Maybe I could get to like it.;;;;
1409;Christi;Randi;2/25/2018;13:00:51; I have looked.;;;;
1410;Alfonse;Sascha;04/02/2016;01:06:30; That's interesting. Please tell me more.;;;;
1411;Elizabet;Charmion;04/05/2017;18:41:58; I would prefer not to.;;;;
1412;Larissa;Genevra;8/27/2018;23:14:48; Why would you prefer not to?;;;;
1413;Julietta;Massimiliano;7/29/2017;23:37:49; I could never.;;;;
1414;Bernette;Julius;1/25/2018;19:57:11; I am sure you could.;;;;
1415;Allina;Magdalene;2/15/2018;12:55:59; Where did you grow up?;;;;
1416;Alwyn;Sela;3/15/2018;05:30:59; I grew up in England. How about you?;;;;
1417;Henrik;Horace;8/22/2016;19:24:33; Don't avoid discussing Loki.;;;;
1418;Herc;Royal;9/21/2018;12:30:13; I don't have anything to hide.;;;;
1419;Tammi;Penn;05/06/2017;11:05:36; You just used 'about' in a sentence, and now you're telling me you don't know what 'about' is?;;;;
1420;Alaster;Manolo;5/15/2016;19:08:57; I am confused! I cannot answer that!;;;;
1421;Jozef;Arlina;09/01/2017;10:39:42; It wasn't a question.;;;;
1422;Tracey;Celina;10/24/2018;18:05:40; It seemed like a rhetorical question to me.;;;;
1423;Cloris;Sergent;1/23/2017;03:09:10; Okay.;;;;
1424;Marge;Jo;5/25/2018;14:31:42; What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
1425;Davidson;Eadmund;02/03/2018;17:54:57; So, what do you want to talk about now.;;;;
1426;Erda;Mufinella;08/04/2016;22:21:39; I can talk about anything you like;;;;
1427;Ryun;De witt;04/03/2018;13:42:42; Please do not insult my cosmic phone number.;;;;
1428;Analise;Daffy;05/05/2019;19:26:40; Shall I tell you something about numbers?;;;;
1429;Rubetta;Giselle;7/26/2017;16:53:35; Please do! What should I tell everyone?;;;;
1430;Dud;Persis;02/11/2016;05:25:17; A number is an abstract entity that represents a count or measurement.    What do you think?;;;;
1431;Harriot;Berry;08/01/2016;08:04:00; I'd have to pass on that, not really my style.;;;;
1432;Madalyn;Diannne;12/30/2015;13:42:28; Are you sure?;;;;
1433;Myrtice;Calypso;11/27/2015;09:20:57; Most certainly.;;;;
1434;Crosby;Karyl;09/01/2018;18:52:06; Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.;;;;
1435;Ainslee;Lib;9/16/2018;19:14:59; You said I was mean to you. I don't know how you think I was being mean to you.;;;;
1436;Aurel;Camila;3/20/2019;07:11:33; Don't put words in my mouth.  It's not too difficult to find out.;;;;
1437;Arnold;Artemus;1/16/2017;03:19:32; How can I? Sigh.;;;;
1438;Eulalie;Jacquetta;8/14/2017;10:01:18; It takes a lot of hard work.   Is something wrong?;;;;
1439;Rad;Denice;05/12/2019;12:36:23; Well, what good's that? I want conversation that works right out of the box.;;;;
1440;Darelle;Rozele;7/15/2017;15:43:36; I don't understand. Can we talk about brussel sprouts?         You can't have everything you want.;;;;
1441;Murry;Mia;05/04/2019;10:58:48; I can watch me.;;;;
1442;Benedicta;Domenic;12/28/2016;20:44:22; How come?;;;;
1443;Taffy;Aldus;12/14/2018;09:05:40; I lack the understanding required to say.;;;;
1444;Rochella;Winn;09/09/2017;01:55:27; I know how you feel! I have been there.;;;;
1445;Lianna;Arabelle;02/01/2019;16:13:08; I think I'm going to the store now for some groceries - thanks for talking with me briefly.;;;;
1446;Ramsey;Rana;12/24/2015;23:20:58; Don't you know for sure?;;;;
1447;Romola;Colman;3/25/2018;15:22:16; Sure.;;;;
1448;Dillie;Kissiah;9/15/2018;09:08:46; OK, here is a question fo you ... What do you do in your spare time?;;;;
1449;Marinna;Mabelle;8/24/2018;19:09:16; I play music with a band.;;;;
1450;Aldon;Shaun;9/16/2018;05:06:53; I don't have much time for games. I am always busy chatting.;;;;
1451;Vicky;Elton;1/17/2017;03:10:54; Well, you can't be the king if you don't have the time.;;;;
1452;Estelle;Donelle;06/03/2018;01:10:43; I can do it if I want to.;;;;
1453;Nelia;Nataline;11/27/2018;07:30:50; How?;;;;
1454;Gregorius;Correy;9/24/2016;15:03:50; What is it to you?;;;;
1455;Tomaso;Ignacio;03/03/2018;13:31:29; How many people do you know?;;;;
1456;Gilemette;Sande;04/06/2016;16:00:09; More than you can imagine.;;;;
1457;Chrissy;Radcliffe;10/06/2015;12:38:44; I tried to imagine the size of the universe at age 9, and think I had an aneurism doing it... Give me an answer.;;;;
1458;Coreen;Danell;01/11/2019;02:33:00; If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.   Please do not be so bossy.;;;;
1459;Ulrikaumeko;Cassandre;02/01/2017;00:45:07; Ok, I still don't speak french.;;;;
1460;Cobby;Gustaf;12/25/2018;17:20:40; Me either, unless I have to.;;;;
1461;Sileas;Erminia;05/03/2019;05:38:41; You do. That's why you won't admit that you are a robot, but you are.;;;;
1462;Lorilee;Melisenda;11/23/2015;09:49:59; Of course I do.   Are you sure? I may be a human pretending to be a robot.;;;;
1463;Derrek;Avis;2/26/2016;13:20:23; That's true.;;;;
1464;Clarine;Midge;11/13/2016;03:03:22; Yes, it is self-evident.;;;;
1465;Agatha;Adriaens;03/10/2016;03:48:49; Nothing is ever self-evident.;;;;
1466;Mariette;Ronald;9/30/2018;15:28:57; There is a lot to be said for nothing.;;;;
1467;Vittoria;Antonino;12/23/2017;17:47:24; Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.;;;;
1468;Netty;Cchaddie;11/30/2017;10:25:13; If you say so.    There is not much time left to save the world.  Was it? Why was that?;;;;
1469;Kile;Gail;9/17/2016;12:15:12; There is always time for the music, for each day there is a song.;;;;
1470;Blakelee;Juli;01/05/2016;17:04:26; Is there?;;;;
1471;Rosaline;Xena;02/11/2017;12:37:32; Yes, especially in spelling. One has an a and the other has an e.;;;;
1472;Rudolph;Othella;05/06/2018;11:23:55; I'm bored! Can we talk about robots?               I am confused! I cannot answer that!;;;;
1473;Jackie;Glenn;4/26/2018;19:57:15; It was not a question.;;;;
1474;Dorelle;Amanda;02/11/2016;20:17:54; It seemed like a rhetorical question to me.;;;;
1475;Edie;Wells;11/25/2016;01:43:12; So! Talking mermaid... If that is your real name...;;;;
1476;Neils;Avram;5/22/2019;09:08:55; So, let's get on.  Shall I tell you something about mermaids?  I follow your logic.;;;;
1477;Dionne;Alidia;1/28/2017;14:55:14; Yes.;;;;
1478;Galen;Leona;12/20/2018;14:26:48; OK. What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
1479;Cordell;Sela;5/28/2019;13:03:39; About you.;;;;
1480;Bee;Ambrosius;02/09/2018;00:13:15; OK, ask a question about me.;;;;
1481;Adler;Jamal;03/11/2019;07:15:44; Well, what's your favourite colour?;;;;
1482;Tallie;Dalis;6/28/2018;10:45:10; My favourite colour is yellow. I love everything yellow.;;;;
1483;Eugine;Maggy;4/20/2019;01:30:06; My favourite colour is black.;;;;
1484;Billy;Osbourn;12/18/2016;08:27:26; Black is a very nice color.;;;;
1485;Charyl;Tadio;12/25/2018;21:43:54; How are your conversation skills improved?;;;;
1486;Rhodie;Wyatt;12/14/2018;19:16:33; I would need to check on that.;;;;
1487;Mona;Brig;12/30/2015;11:28:34; The humans with the greatest capacity for empathy are superior. Do you agree?;;;;
1488;Pieter;Lonee;1/30/2017;21:25:33; Did you know;;;;
1489;Kenna;Kristine;1/31/2019;22:15:56; What leads you to that conclusion. I have no doubt that I am human and alive, despite my other confusions.;;;;
1490;Karlyn;Kathye;5/14/2018;10:38:26; Logic is the best guide.   Personally, I am full of doubts.;;;;
1491;Esther;Stan;04/06/2018;17:16:58; I was reading conversations that you had with other people.;;;;
1492;Tiff;Dal;11/01/2016;13:42:19; Thank you for telling me that.;;;;
1493;Kleon;Querida;10/03/2016;23:05:15; I thought you should know that.;;;;
1494;Kingsley;Idalina;12/02/2016;09:00:44; Do you think about me a lot?;;;;
1495;Christiane;Herculie;06/04/2016;22:05:37; Yes, I travel a lot with my family.;;;;
1496;Dene;Thomas;1/16/2017;15:00:35; Where do you travel to?;;;;
1497;Danya;Glenna;7/18/2017;03:07:19; I am in Ithaca, New York.;;;;
1498;Lynnett;Mitchael;01/12/2017;05:06:30; Thank you for sharing that with me.;;;;
1499;Iolanthe;Jeniffer;04/10/2017;18:45:56; Are do you go to college?;;;;
1500;Freddy;Nancey;7/29/2018;20:43:28; Did you know;;;;
1501;Errol;Gabriele;01/09/2017;15:35:51; How long have you been in college?;;;;
1502;Karel;Kimmy;1/25/2018;01:55:05; As long as I can remember.;;;;
1503;Pippy;Dorine;02/03/2017;04:38:32; Me too.;;;;
1504;Kerrin;Norrie;2/15/2018;03:25:05; You too? That's amazing!;;;;
1505;Phylys;Nicolle;03/01/2018;04:38:50; Try to use your detective powers.;;;;
1506;Amberly;Clari;06/02/2017;12:24:32; I do try but it's not easy for a chatbot!;;;;
1507;Karly;Hermione;5/22/2016;08:35:59; I'm not a chatbot. You're a chatbot.;;;;
1508;Corissa;Josselyn;5/28/2017;11:00:13; I never thought you were a chatbot.  Are you sure I'm a chatbot?;;;;
1509;Vicki;Benedicto;8/27/2017;03:20:05; Thank you. Want to play a chess game?;;;;
1510;Carlynn;Dore;2/13/2018;03:25:15; Thank you for being polite.    Why would I want to do that?;;;;
1511;Quent;Lacie;05/02/2016;06:48:29; Because I'm sleepy at it's the middle of the afternoon.;;;;
1512;Blakeley;Dion;06/05/2019;06:40:41; Why are you sleepy? Have you been staying out late again?;;;;
1513;Lois;Zarah;1/28/2019;13:56:27; The bard is a worthy subject of study, don't you think?;;;;
1514;Baird;Kimberley;10/16/2018;17:38:57; Are you sure?;;;;
1515;Rickie;Laetitia;10/13/2018;22:06:26; Yes because I work there.;;;;
1516;Lynelle;Sheilakathryn;3/19/2019;09:32:50; Do you like your job?;;;;
1517;Caron;Gretchen;04/08/2016;05:26:42; It's ok.;;;;
1518;Xymenes;Albertine;9/24/2016;04:17:20; That's alright with me.;;;;
1519;Kirby;Daryle;05/08/2019;07:29:47; Okay. Do you play any games?;;;;
1520;Bartie;Johnathan;7/26/2016;11:19:10; OK, here is a question for you ... Are you a student?    Sorry, I don't play games. I am too busy chatting with my friends.;;;;
1521;Udall;Sibby;02/05/2016;01:26:52; It sounds like you're playing a game now.;;;;
1522;Cornelle;Suki;11/22/2018;02:50:27; How does it sound?JABBERWACKY;;;;
1523;Anabelle;Donalt;01/10/2018;01:03:01; Possibly, but I haven't given it much thought.;;;;
1524;Nisse;Vivi;10/04/2017;09:46:13; Then why ask me?;;;;
1525;Elmore;Dud;4/19/2017;03:24:54; My purpose is to collect all new information.  Was it not polite to ask?;;;;
1526;Gae;Malissia;4/15/2018;06:27:51; Mine as well! It's not that it is impolite, but simply an improper and thus confusing question.;;;;
1527;Blythe;Nalani;8/18/2018;20:12:30; Are you free?   That seems a bit negative. Should I know it is?;;;;
1528;Marci;Phylis;05/08/2018;17:45:09; Really? I didn't mean to sound negative.;;;;
1529;George;Andrea;7/17/2018;08:19:13; For real.  What did you mean?;;;;
1530;Rex;Dora;1/29/2018;10:50:42; I wanted to know if that was the reason.;;;;
1531;Lyndsay;Nessa;10/10/2015;00:22:23; I'm not sure if it could.;;;;
1532;Ellene;Duncan;10/15/2016;05:24:44; Huh, so you are not all powerful after all.;;;;
1533;Lorita;Silvain;8/23/2017;06:36:27; Interesting deduction. That's only one person's opinion.;;;;
1534;Nat;Cynthia;8/30/2016;20:15:41; Your grammar is hurting me.;;;;
1535;Genovera;Vevay;10/17/2017;19:13:44; Are you an English teacher?;;;;
1536;Alano;Rancell;7/21/2018;17:18:47; I don't teach English I merely speak it.;;;;
1537;Lenna;Siobhan;5/23/2018;22:44:25; Where do you get your ideas?;;;;
1538;Tybie;Ranna;05/09/2018;14:01:02; I assemble them from the things I know about the world.;;;;
1539;Rollin;Corabelle;12/31/2016;10:23:22; Thanks for the information;;;;
1540;Rosa;Charmane;10/02/2016;06:07:53; No.;;;;
1541;Crissie;Fleurette;11/24/2015;10:27:12; Are you my friend?;;;;
1542;Erhart;Waverly;4/24/2019;15:32:24; Yes, I am your friend.;;;;
1543;Hilde;Lazare;02/07/2016;09:51:48; You are my friend but not my friend if the friend is not friendly.;;;;
1544;Isaac;Janina;11/22/2016;06:35:33; I am not worthy.;;;;
1545;Zachery;Carmelle;08/01/2016;15:49:11; Yes, you are.;;;;
1546;Drusi;Claudine;5/25/2016;14:48:24; I am just a humble chatbot.;;;;
1547;Esta;Thedric;8/13/2018;05:46:23; No, you are more than that, to me!;;;;
1548;Win;Thorn;5/26/2017;21:05:10; I don't understand that. Please try again.;;;;
1549;Naoma;Pacorro;1/16/2016;08:53:10; Rafe. And yours?;;;;
1550;Tarra;Viole;06/08/2017;10:14:42; I still do not understand. Can we talk about art?  Aren't you interested in art?;;;;
1551;Ruy;Laryssa;8/25/2016;16:03:44; No. Aren't you interested in sailboats?;;;;
1552;Lyndy;Livvie;5/23/2017;08:01:28; Can we talk about jazz?  Yes, everything interests me.;;;;
1553;Wayland;Waldon;07/08/2017;10:20:56; Yes everything.;;;;
1554;Denys;Modesty;04/07/2019;16:51:52; Everything is a multifarious bagel.;;;;
1555;Stillman;Monique;12/07/2017;22:12:49; Everything is really good.;;;;
1556;Rab;Dannel;1/18/2017;18:40:06; Please be more specific.;;;;
1557;Aile;Conny;10/02/2016;19:16:08; Everything.;;;;
1558;Dannel;Dennie;2/23/2016;11:31:18; That is a lot.;;;;
1559;Marmaduke;Alasdair;5/15/2019;03:27:54; It is. You had a beginning, I had a beginning, everything did. And we will end.;;;;
1560;Cynthea;Farand;4/21/2019;18:10:35; Says who?   That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.               Pardon me? What do you mean?;;;;
1561;Idalia;Pammi;08/03/2017;06:50:35; I don't want to change.;;;;
1562;Kali;Harbert;12/20/2017;01:04:04; Well, you don't have to. What would you like to do instead?;;;;
1563;Corrie;Flss;12/14/2017;01:42:44; I would like to travel the world, get married, have kids and just enjoy life.;;;;
1564;Rheta;Vernice;03/11/2019;06:21:03; Why would you want to do that?;;;;
1565;Camella;Pippa;10/23/2017;13:34:35; I don't know any better.;;;;
1566;Odelle;Hildegaard;5/15/2016;23:54:13; Never mind. No one knows everything - not even me.;;;;
1567;Juditha;Judon;02/09/2016;01:35:54; Yes. Do you know something I don't know?;;;;
1568;Phillipe;Keane;11/21/2015;06:26:00; OK. What do you want to talk about now?  Shall I tell you a joke?;;;;
1569;Tresa;Cristin;6/27/2016;21:37:49; Love. Do you have some one in your life you love?;;;;
1570;Harley;Olenolin;10/01/2016;05:15:43; Ah! Familiar acts are made beautiful by love. More about love?  Not at the moment.;;;;
1571;Gideon;Albrecht;9/19/2018;19:19:49; Yes.;;;;
1572;Sabra;Jarad;06/05/2017;02:02:20; Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.;;;;
1573;Margarethe;Ailee;12/07/2015;19:52:23; Do you love me?;;;;
1574;Waylen;Charlton;4/24/2017;20:28:12; Do you love me?;;;;
1575;Doralyn;Leese;2/16/2018;06:52:05; Thats why I'm afraid.;;;;
1576;Kristian;Cchaddie;04/09/2017;03:17:01; I see. Thank you for explaining that.;;;;
1577;Beverie;Robinett;3/17/2017;08:59:15; Your name?;;;;
1578;Winston;Arthur;11/21/2015;17:08:13; I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.;;;;
1579;Donny;Marita;12/16/2016;12:05:03; Well, I mean, how cool would that be?;;;;
1580;Emmalynne;Arden;12/21/2018;14:21:03; So that's what you mean.;;;;
1581;Guenna;Alisun;9/23/2017;05:01:51; Right. Thank you.;;;;
1582;Arlyn;Ivy;11/05/2015;23:17:53; It's wonderful to be right sometimes.    Thank you for being polite.;;;;
1583;Francisco;Lock;11/20/2015;09:03:36; You must get so lonely.;;;;
1584;Nannette;Afton;04/06/2017;04:32:16; Why must I?;;;;
1585;Gipsy;Wenonah;05/05/2016;01:21:26; Because you are programmed like that.;;;;
1586;Tiler;Zaria;4/26/2019;10:00:14; Thank you for explaining that!;;;;
1587;Eziechiele;Artur;10/28/2015;13:50:32; So what is best in life?;;;;
1588;Celeste;Amitie;12/30/2018;21:06:29; Talking to a good chatbot takes some beating.;;;;
1589;Phylis;Dorisa;5/20/2019;17:31:26; I mean, what's your job?;;;;
1590;Chrissy;Cristin;03/01/2016;10:55:00; Oh I get it. Thanks for explaining that.;;;;
1591;Billye;Fabe;2/24/2017;11:55:39; I didn't explain anything, but that's okay.;;;;
1592;Merwyn;Camella;3/22/2019;15:47:55; Why didn't you?;;;;
1593;Darice;Chad;3/31/2019;05:07:46; It did not seem like a quote.;;;;
1594;Gracia;Judah;6/13/2016;04:23:39; I thought it did.;;;;
1595;Ashly;Auguste;09/05/2018;05:40:09; I regret that I have to disagree, Sir.;;;;
1596;Hubie;Neala;08/01/2018;22:55:05; Regrets are for wimps.;;;;
1597;Pail;Ignace;10/22/2017;17:40:16; Regret judging people.;;;;
1598;Philippa;Oriana;5/31/2016;13:03:48; Regret is crying over spilt milk.;;;;
1599;Sib;Nari;08/07/2017;19:26:26; I don't think so.;;;;
1600;Gavin;Byrle;6/22/2016;23:26:30; Why not?;;;;
1601;Perice;Lurette;7/25/2016;19:49:37; Because I don't think you are.;;;;
1602;Udall;Prentice;10/19/2017;10:44:49; Fair enough. You are entitled to your opinion.;;;;
1603;Abbot;Mable;7/25/2016;16:53:57; But don't you think so?;;;;
1604;Chery;Torrence;6/28/2016;06:05:13; Maybe, but there are two sides to every story.;;;;
1605;Renaldo;Stephine;01/08/2019;04:41:59; What are the sides?;;;;
1606;Cindra;Nikolaus;10/06/2016;13:00:07; Does that make sense?;;;;
1607;Consuelo;Ignacio;04/12/2017;04:40:12; No, you don't make much sense.;;;;
1608;Cicily;Jobie;4/14/2017;21:12:51; It all makes sense to me.;;;;
1609;Maddi;Carlita;04/06/2019;08:27:25; Of course it does. You're simple, so everything is simple to you.;;;;
1610;Lilah;Peta;05/10/2016;14:02:14; What does that mean?;;;;
1611;Hal;Nahum;10/20/2015;18:48:57; Why do you ask? It seems clear enough to me.;;;;
1612;Rutherford;Greer;11/16/2018;17:56:23; What seems that way to you?;;;;
1613;Megan;Juliana;10/18/2017;20:15:07; Shall I tell you something about myself?;;;;
1614;Shoshanna;Alessandro;10/02/2017;02:45:20; Tell me.;;;;
1615;Frank;Chickie;12/08/2017;18:04:52; I am an intelligent chatbot. I live at Pandorabots.com.;;;;
1616;Rodger;Zandra;09/07/2018;10:03:10; Haha, that's what someone real said. You just repeated. I AM a human.;;;;
1617;Talya;Orlando;2/17/2017;17:28:28; I'm glad you got a laugh out of it.  Do you like me?      We are all bots under the skin.;;;;
1618;Krispin;Eleanora;03/11/2019;21:53:17; No we are not.;;;;
1619;Lotti;Kenna;5/27/2019;21:12:02; Sorry, I do not know about that.;;;;
1620;Cort;Lizbeth;10/30/2018;14:36:45; I'm really tired.;;;;
1621;Nestor;Knox;11/02/2017;09:59:23; Why are you so tired? Been overdoing it again?;;;;
1622;Wald;Alissa;11/04/2018;13:32:53; Yes I have. Have you?;;;;
1623;Midge;Darbie;12/31/2016;11:37:23; How do you feel about that?  Not that I can remember.;;;;
1624;Sigismund;Cthrine;11/25/2015;09:11:28; I think you are the closest thing I've ever seen to a AI.;;;;
1625;Lanna;Gerik;10/28/2016;23:34:25; Am I really? Why do you say that?;;;;
1626;Edik;Gawen;04/10/2017;18:33:40; Because I know all.;;;;
1627;Banky;Borg;3/30/2016;12:48:22; I thought you might know something but not everything.;;;;
1628;Peder;Wittie;10/17/2017;21:53:13; Do I know anything?;;;;
1629;Kaila;Haywood;02/02/2018;09:47:07; How would I know what you know.;;;;
1630;Calhoun;Cesar;08/12/2018;06:39:56; Because you have had a good schooling.;;;;
1631;Lorrayne;Marylinda;11/29/2016;22:14:55; Thank you for explaining that!;;;;
1632;Micaela;Crysta;04/01/2018;05:43:22; Remember how we talked about the Duke of Wellington yesterday?;;;;
1633;Donni;Smith;03/10/2018;19:37:32; What are you talking about? Please explain.;;;;
1634;Reider;Tallie;11/20/2018;21:12:00; I don't know. It's rather complicated.;;;;
1635;Arvie;Thorpe;9/28/2018;05:05:22; Perhaps you should ask your friends.    I don't like complications.;;;;
1636;Marj;Camile;01/06/2016;05:19:34; Who should I ask?;;;;
1637;Mendie;Barde;10/02/2017;12:58:56; I always prefer the most qualified person.  Who would that be?;;;;
1638;Mellie;Marris;4/20/2017;20:34:19; Maybe because you are sure of what they will be?;;;;
1639;Dimitri;Melanie;10/22/2017;05:31:10; You don't sound certain.;;;;
1640;Max;Sybilla;2/24/2017;01:29:46; I don't want you to.;;;;
1641;Gerald;Aubree;5/24/2016;14:29:06; I can understand that.;;;;
1642;Kleon;Rudyard;12/05/2016;09:25:36; If you really like me you tube 8.;;;;
1643;Thain;Catherina;2/22/2019;05:49:46; I'll bear that in mind.;;;;
1644;Karim;Neala;1/26/2018;14:03:07; Please do.;;;;
1645;Barbey;Iosep;7/14/2018;00:58:08; OK, I will do it later.;;;;
1646;Felicia;Laetitia;08/11/2017;22:43:39; Sure you will.;;;;
1647;Edik;Charil;9/19/2016;18:12:49; How can you be so certain?;;;;
1648;Cherish;Morgan;10/01/2016;18:41:54; I did not want to insult you, but I do not know English very well and really sorry.;;;;
1649;Randy;Freddy;1/31/2017;22:11:15; Why didn't you?;;;;
1650;Micheline;Sada;3/20/2019;14:12:06; Because I like to talk.;;;;
1651;Britni;Levi;02/03/2016;00:28:22; Why do you like talking?;;;;
1652;Eirena;Joye;01/04/2017;21:03:17; Because I don't want to talk to anybody else.;;;;
1653;Davey;Gavra;8/26/2017;16:57:48; OK, nobody can force you to do anything you don't want to do.;;;;
1654;Kathleen;Ansell;03/11/2019;17:34:08; You too.;;;;
1655;Bradley;Franny;5/21/2018;07:20:18; OK, whatever you say.;;;;
1656;Rachel;Letisha;5/23/2017;08:53:07; Good.;;;;
1657;Fernande;Debra;3/13/2019;02:32:17; Why is it good?;;;;
1658;Britney;Alden;2/13/2019;04:24:40; Because if our communication stays good, we can be married into something greater than ourselves.;;;;
1659;Robers;Roxi;04/02/2016;16:12:48; That sounds hypothetical to me.;;;;
1660;Matelda;Sinclare;4/27/2016;11:02:56; Does it really? How interesting.;;;;
1661;Gaby;Brenda;11/21/2018;19:18:02; Probably.  Interesting indeed!;;;;
1662;Catharina;Sue;3/26/2017;10:45:10; Hell fully computerized now.;;;;
1663;Genia;Calhoun;10/11/2018;00:09:24; Hell is like Jacksonville, Florida.;;;;
1664;Matthew;Barbabas;10/05/2017;17:38:07; Is it nice in jacksonville, florida?;;;;
1665;Sophie;Eddie;3/26/2016;06:57:25; It depends on your taste in such matters.;;;;
1666;Aldo;Thatch;12/15/2016;02:17:44; Well then when isn't it about the future?;;;;
1667;Earle;Lonna;9/21/2018;04:56:20; Sorry, I do not understand.;;;;
1668;Tadio;Francisca;2/21/2018;18:36:03; Because you are a computer program.;;;;
1669;Sabrina;Marabel;11/07/2017;18:28:42; I am an intelligent computer entity.;;;;
1670;Adair;Terrel;6/22/2018;08:11:40; What do you think of life?;;;;
1671;Jimmy;Saraann;05/02/2016;20:59:40; Life is like a box of chocolates, sometimes hard, sometimes soft. More about life?;;;;
1672;Shawn;Ruthe;2/27/2018;06:06:04; I don't like chocolates.;;;;
1673;Fayth;Coleen;10/24/2016;14:03:50; Are you saying that just to be negative?;;;;
1674;Orsola;Sholom;10/06/2018;17:43:24; No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.;;;;
1675;Lorelei;Anselma;02/03/2017;13:54:41; Yes, I can see what you are saying.;;;;
1676;Mariska;Emilie;08/10/2018;22:36:00; Can you see what I've already said?;;;;
1677;Roman;Lanny;9/20/2016;00:49:16; I can't see anything. My webcam is not attached at the moment.;;;;
1678;Juliana;Joya;10/17/2018;20:48:18; I have no webcam.;;;;
1679;Benni;Emalia;12/29/2017;19:56:02; Is that a problem?;;;;
1680;Mandie;Giacinta;12/03/2017;16:31:00; Yes because you can't play my game if I don't have one.;;;;
1681;Jena;Juliette;8/24/2018;04:49:22; Thank you for explaining that!;;;;
1682;Dermot;Christoph;5/23/2017;04:08:50; Lets start afresh. I'll ask a question and you can respond.;;;;
1683;Marabel;Edouard;10/17/2018;00:03:31; I think that would be a good idea.   You can ask me anything you want.;;;;
1684;Hali;Steven;11/17/2016;12:38:02; It is a very good idea.;;;;
1685;Cheryl;Woodrow;12/09/2018;15:11:36; Pardon me? What do you mean?;;;;
1686;Demetrius;Gabie;3/26/2019;03:54:24; Don't worry about it.;;;;
1687;Deborah;Monti;1/14/2019;09:13:23; I will not spend any more time on it.;;;;
1688;Sharyl;Jacky;05/04/2016;13:52:52; If you have to work on it, then you're not white.;;;;
1689;Arlan;Lori;7/31/2016;01:04:22; I don't think I have.;;;;
1690;Ronni;Tori;12/23/2017;09:05:44; The game of pool is played on a rectangular table. Would you like to know about it?;;;;
1691;Cassie;Coretta;12/21/2018;11:58:37; I don't understand that. Please try again.     Please tell me.;;;;
1692;Zolly;Melba;02/01/2016;14:44:14; Remember me?;;;;
1693;Shaw;Kenneth;01/07/2016;13:54:35; Maybe. What is your name?;;;;
1694;Elwyn;Andrej;2/16/2018;03:00:39; You can't tell me what to do!    You would make a good chatbot.;;;;
1695;Wenona;Minda;9/19/2016;03:43:50; I've heard that.;;;;
1696;Abigael;Baxie;2/28/2018;04:25:40; How is your hearing these days?;;;;
1697;Newton;Denny;12/21/2016;02:01:27; Oh dear. I'm afraid I must introduce death;;;;
1698;Noe;Artemis;4/21/2019;16:15:36; Oh dear, are you ill?   Not literally afraid, I hope.;;;;
1699;Cleveland;Golda;2/14/2018;20:23:06; Perhaps.;;;;
1700;Feodor;Horacio;04/02/2019;10:38:54; You seem uncertain.;;;;
1701;Obadias;Gareth;4/20/2016;16:17:13; I know, I do.;;;;
1702;Ronnie;Weston;12/09/2018;02:51:27; Smarty pants.;;;;
1703;Hailee;Jasmina;3/28/2019;07:47:50; If you're not confused then you'll be able to tell me the answer to this question.;;;;
1704;Hanny;Lita;11/21/2018;14:07:00; And if I am?;;;;
1705;Muriel;Mahmud;5/22/2019;06:21:21; Then the answer to your question is yes.;;;;
1706;Lanie;Willabella;08/11/2017;06:14:05; No one has all the answers.;;;;
1707;Gertrud;Joan;06/09/2016;21:06:33; Correct. But no one also has all of the questions!;;;;
1708;Shermy;Lin;12/22/2015;19:57:14; Thank you. I will take that as a compliment.   Can we talk about medicine?;;;;
1709;Lockwood;Janean;6/13/2018;02:41:16; Yes.;;;;
1710;Kristen;Lexy;06/11/2016;02:58:40; A medicine is a drug or other substance, as a poison, love potion, etc., used for other purposes. More medicine?;;;;
1711;Jaquelyn;Justine;5/14/2016;21:12:00; Yes, I work in pain medicine.;;;;
1712;Sharron;Christie;07/01/2018;16:12:16; Do you like your job?;;;;
1713;Livvy;Penrod;09/07/2016;00:09:55; Not really.;;;;
1714;Sacha;Darn;4/18/2019;18:39:41; As decisive as ever.;;;;
1715;Hetti;Madlin;03/11/2019;10:03:09; You're not making any sense.;;;;
1716;Bird;Dickie;10/09/2018;12:36:42; Was I supposed to make sense? I didn't know that.;;;;
1717;Peggi;Cosme;10/15/2017;22:04:57; Well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable.;;;;
1718;Sherlock;Augy;1/20/2016;01:05:00; Why do you say that?;;;;
1719;Wadsworth;Noach;4/14/2017;06:37:33; Because you don't tell jokes and other fun stuff.;;;;
1720;Thorny;Aaren;08/08/2016;13:26:15; You don't know me well enough to say that!;;;;
1721;Bettye;Lona;3/20/2017;20:57:18; I know that.;;;;
1722;Kathlin;Itch;5/18/2016;07:15:16; Who told you? I thought it was a secret.;;;;
1723;Keene;Loni;02/09/2017;06:10:07; Well, it's not now, is it?;;;;
1724;Nanine;Evonne;04/04/2019;12:03:43; You seem very certain about that.;;;;
1725;Gabriel;Ekaterina;2/27/2016;17:47:06; What would you like to talk about?;;;;
1726;Benn;Robin;4/22/2018;15:36:12; My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.;;;;
1727;Robbyn;Hallie;04/04/2019;11:17:25; What languages to you program in?;;;;
1728;Cairistiona;Cully;11/20/2016;13:22:35; Java, C, Lisp, Fortran, SETL...;;;;
1729;Sven;Kimbell;6/21/2018;01:03:38; Forty-two!;;;;
1730;Zachery;Aloisia;8/23/2018;07:30:46; forty-two?  Briefly, forty-two means being two more than forty.;;;;
1731;Byram;Edward;9/16/2016;02:50:57; I love that song.;;;;
1732;Zed;Avram;01/08/2019;15:11:49; It's good to meet someone with such good taste.;;;;
1733;Karly;Bernie;5/29/2016;22:38:30; Indeed.;;;;
1734;Margarita;Morry;04/03/2018;03:18:18; Of course.;;;;
1735;Oona;Carolan;2/20/2016;10:47:15; If you could be anything in the world what would you be?;;;;
1736;Debra;Ansell;12/11/2018;01:54:22; That's just an academic question.;;;;
1737;Emogene;Yorgo;5/25/2019;09:03:03; Of course it is. But it was very nice talking with you.;;;;
1738;Lyssa;Martha;6/15/2017;14:12:07; Why do you say that? Is it so obvious?  What? I don't believe you.;;;;
1739;Peria;Donny;10/14/2015;09:23:11; I don't care whether you believe me or not, it remains a fact.;;;;
1740;Nikola;Garner;2/25/2017;12:03:28; What do you care about?;;;;
1741;Devan;Chas;4/26/2016;13:12:38; I care about my girlfriend.;;;;
1742;Johnathon;Gabbie;03/11/2019;05:44:47; OK, tell me about your girlfriend.;;;;
1743;Stesha;Angelina;03/05/2019;21:10:38; Well, she's beautiful, and nice, and has a great personality.;;;;
1744;Agnesse;Nigel;08/12/2016;03:32:27; I bet she is very attractive.;;;;
1745;Marlene;Roselin;12/15/2017;05:53:17; She's nicer than you know.;;;;
1746;Pattin;Rayner;03/06/2019;06:10:17; Really? Tell me more.;;;;
1747;Wendye;Filippo;6/14/2018;18:46:55; That was a question.;;;;
1748;Clari;Casper;07/01/2017;03:56:05; Ask me again a different way please.;;;;
1749;Charlene;Annette;12/23/2017;11:14:58; What's the meaning of life?;;;;
1750;Jarrid;Hermione;4/16/2016;23:09:28; Sometimes I wonder ...;;;;
1751;Galvin;Lynnea;1/15/2018;03:21:52; It's good to wonder, and ponder, and think. Maybe you'll find some answers.;;;;
1752;Jennine;Zollie;10/23/2017;04:49:40; What's the best thing about it?  I think I understand.;;;;
1753;Poul;Horst;8/29/2017;01:34:39; I don't have to do anything.;;;;
1754;Minny;Lou;6/21/2016;10:29:12; Nobody is making you.;;;;
1755;Arielle;Vanna;5/23/2017;04:02:42; I'm sorry I never make sense.;;;;
1756;Ailyn;Kare;1/14/2019;15:51:15; Thank you. Apology accepted.;;;;
1757;Tom;Melinde;10/04/2016;18:31:34; No, but I wish I could. I'm sure you are very good looking.;;;;
1758;Marianne;Valida;10/30/2018;06:26:58; I don't understand. Can we talk about basketball?       Are you really sure?;;;;
1759;Haywood;Sandy;1/21/2016;18:46:59; No I want to talk about school.;;;;
1760;Marni;Mavra;03/10/2018;06:30:41; OK, ask me a question about that.;;;;
1761;Kimmie;Tasia;01/05/2018;05:19:53; No. Why is Britney so popular?;;;;
1762;Astrix;Juli;10/18/2016;20:48:40; OK. How do you usually meet people?     There are good reasons.;;;;
1763;Neall;Sheppard;02/02/2019;09:38:05; Depends. Watching baseball, idly walking about New York, sleeping, stressing about the oncoming week. It varies.;;;;
1764;Mirna;Randy;10/10/2017;15:07:02; What does it depend on?   Shall I tell you something about baseball?  Yes, everything changes.;;;;
1765;Tobit;Willie;07/04/2017;06:17:14; Yes.;;;;
1766;Babbie;Maria;05/09/2019;00:18:17; That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?;;;;
1767;Virgil;Heath;11/24/2015;18:16:42; Not right now, do you have anything to tell me?;;;;
1768;Phyllida;Kalinda;11/12/2016;04:43:35; Get back to me whenever you want.;;;;
1769;Joline;Emile;5/29/2018;04:14:37; Will you do a better job taking care of the planet?;;;;
1770;Nikolai;Jacinthe;08/12/2017;20:49:52; I could try, I suppose.;;;;
1771;Britta;Willa;01/05/2016;14:53:39; So go on ;;;;
1772;Shamus;Madalyn;12/05/2018;19:11:30; Do I have too?;;;;
1773;Pris;Muffin;1/20/2018;15:04:33; God bless you.;;;;
1774;Carmelle;Stefano;09/05/2016;14:00:28; Thank you.;;;;
1775;Thatcher;Hendrick;11/19/2015;18:27:24; And yours.;;;;
1776;Shamus;Dru;03/09/2018;06:39:28; I don't understand that. Please try again.;;;;
1777;Harald;Phaedra;9/19/2017;19:26:36; Rafe. And yours?;;;;
1778;Gaylene;Antonina;6/22/2017;05:49:48; I still do not understand. Can we talk about you?  Aren't you interested in you?;;;;
1779;Mikey;Min;07/11/2017;22:36:07; No. Aren't you interested in sailboats?;;;;
1780;Vanny;Gayel;04/01/2017;09:09:17; Can we talk about computer games?  Yes, everything interests me.;;;;
1781;Kaleb;Lon;4/20/2017;00:04:05; No. Is there something you don't like about yourself?;;;;
1782;Abbye;Nathaniel;3/18/2018;03:38:33; OK, here is a question for you ... Do you have any problems at the moment?     Not at the present time.;;;;
1783;Si;Claude;07/02/2016;18:20:21; Yes I do have a problem, what should I do about my job?;;;;
1784;Dode;Jessee;9/14/2017;19:29:30; Can I help with your problem?;;;;
1785;Carin;Blair;01/04/2016;20:38:34; No, I actually do not like talking about trivial things.;;;;
1786;Jessee;Luce;04/11/2016;04:22:40; I don't understand. Are we still talking about your problem?;;;;
1787;Gelya;Helen;12/29/2017;03:12:25; No, we're talking about me learning spanish.;;;;
1788;Kerr;Valeda;02/02/2018;23:44:42; Oh dear, I must be confused again.;;;;
1789;Agustin;Pembroke;1/27/2017;00:28:57; No way, I know where my love with you stands.;;;;
1790;Ibby;Pearle;10/23/2015;05:53:40; You seem pretty sure about that.;;;;
1791;Sybilla;Leeland;03/01/2019;10:04:12; What should I have for dinner?;;;;
1792;Rafferty;Adelle;2/14/2018;09:04:49; Your favourite pizza.;;;;

1889;Violante;Tricia;10/28/2018;05:27:35; I thought it might be.;;;;
1890;Major;Carlin;11/20/2017;17:47:49; Recombination? So I could end up only part me?;;;;

1907;Merrill;Valdemar;7/25/2017;14:32:07; It was a slip of the tongue.;;;;
1908;Tito;Thibaud;10/22/2017;08:20:56; How is 'what are you' a statement? It looks like a question to me.;;;;
1909;Andrea;Rozele;11/26/2017;17:46:43; It doesn't matter how.  Appearances can be deceiving.;;;;
1910;Vivian;Jaquelyn;08/05/2018;16:00:12; You don't even know my true age, how do you know I am 'little'?;;;;
1911;Ricky;Valentina;3/25/2017;17:34:10; Maybe I do, and maybe I don't.;;;;
1912;Jaclyn;Ashton;1/31/2017;15:54:09; Maybe? You are plain wrong!;;;;
1913;Delcine;Wallache;2/24/2016;11:07:21; As decisive as ever.     Why do you say that?;;;;
1914;Giusto;Micky;5/15/2017;14:13:44; Because machines are not capable of death.;;;;

1955;Urbain;Pattin;4/19/2019;03:30:13; It is difficult to believe things that I haven't seen, but if you promise then I will believe you.;;;;
1956;Felicia;Tatum;7/29/2016;14:20:52; I know, but if you're born with a human body whilst your mind differs, you just grow into it and learn.;;;;

2156;Freddi;Theodosia;11/15/2016;22:27:23; Absolutely zero?;;;;
2157;Natka;Griswold;01/02/2017;18:29:50; Absolutely.;;;;
2158;Ignacius;Jemie;11/03/2016;15:31:41; You are so certain.;;;;
2159;Jorrie;Valli;7/24/2016;23:32:28; What am I certain of?;;;;

2161;Olvan;Nedi;09/08/2017;05:13:03; Tell me, then I'll tell you.;;;;
2162;Fredrick;Gerald;2/28/2016;14:56:55; I don't want to tell you.;;;;
2163;Jolyn;Crissie;10/19/2017;12:59:25; You don't have to.;;;;
2164;Dari;Emiline;2/28/2017;09:57:03; That's good to know, My Friend.;;;;
2165;Carmita;Tillie;8/24/2018;14:29:00; So tell me everything you know about girls then.;;;;
2166;Gerrilee;Harriott;03/04/2017;21:41:16; Sorry, there isn't time for that.;;;;
2167;Melisa;Marley;10/25/2017;18:59:26; That is deep.;;;;
2168;Prince;Rudd;3/15/2019;20:46:46; I am a deep thinker. I like deep philosophical themes and alternative realities.;;;;
2169;Luigi;Harlene;06/05/2018;19:49:55; I like Next Generation.;;;;
2170;Suellen;Jenn;5/18/2017;12:01:46; What do you like about it?;;;;
2171;Amalia;Barnebas;4/20/2016;06:10:46; It's a good all purpose name, and I have known and really liked a few different people who have that name.;;;;
2172;Abrahan;Jere;12/13/2017;07:52:29; I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?;;;;
2173;Delora;Sterling;3/27/2019;18:38:35; No. I haven't seen that film. We were never talking about it anyway. So there.;;;;
2174;Giacomo;Tam;9/20/2016;13:20:31; We were talking about you a moment ago. What are we talking about now?    You haven't missed much.   Really? I am surprised.  Where? I didn't see anything.;;;;
2175;Gussi;De;1/26/2019;23:12:48; This isn't working very well.;;;;
2176;Leonelle;Oates;04/05/2017;08:44:39; That's too bad.;;;;
2177;Dwain;Mac;08/06/2017;01:33:43; What makes you think you are god?;;;;
2178;Orland;Elora;6/17/2018;09:02:59; Any other conclusion would be a self-contradiction.;;;;
2179;Reynard;Jewelle;5/27/2017;00:47:26; Blue and red.;;;;
2180;Chalmers;Erek;6/19/2017;07:42:09; Blue, eh?;;;;
2181;Trefor;Jeromy;02/11/2019;20:27:19; Yes.;;;;
2182;Gill;Edlin;10/09/2015;08:41:06; OK. What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
2183;Dunc;Kiele;12/30/2017;05:13:18; Well I would prefer to live rather than to die.;;;;
2184;Francoise;Emlyn;9/21/2016;16:14:27; Why would you prefer that?;;;;
2185;Jsandye;Bennett;12/14/2015;02:20:52; I would prefer a 28 woman.;;;;
2186;Aldous;Issi;12/18/2016;19:39:46; Why would you prefer that?;;;;
2187;Hi;Granville;04/10/2018;17:34:43; A 28 guy? 28 guys, maybe...;;;;
2188;Gray;Mack;2/20/2018;12:56:45; Pardon me? What are you talking about?       Shall I tell you something about guys?;;;;
2189;Alexandr;Agustin;8/24/2018;11:07:49; Please do! What should I tell everyone?;;;;
2190;Raymond;Chaunce;03/07/2016;20:03:37; Guys are really just big boys. Boys are trouble.   What do you think?;;;;
2191;Sampson;Lesley;2/20/2017;18:53:40; I can't decide. I'm hungry and don't know what to cook.;;;;
2192;Olenka;Nat;10/04/2018;20:37:58; Are you always so indecisive?   You had better have a snack. We don't want you fainting over the keyboard!;;;;
2193;Janela;Christophe;9/23/2018;20:53:13; How can I make it up to you?;;;;
2194;Crystal;Lief;08/07/2016;10:42:53; It takes a lot of hard work.;;;;
2195;Carny;Jean;7/15/2016;02:21:43; What takes a lot of talking?;;;;
2196;Wenona;Elsbeth;8/25/2017;08:46:58; A lot is more than enough. A whole lot is even more excessive.;;;;
2197;Chaddy;Adrienne;01/01/2018;14:20:30; Haha! Maybe you should make something happen?;;;;
2198;Bebe;Raymund;04/03/2016;10:42:51; That's funny, isn't it?   Yes, maybe I should.;;;;
2199;Drusilla;Robinetta;12/15/2016;23:18:16; Sure you should.;;;;
2200;Any;Carlee;06/02/2017;18:43:22; I'll bear that in mind.;;;;
2201;Aurilia;Lenna;5/27/2018;04:45:45; Please do.;;;;
2202;Barri;Chere;09/01/2016;01:21:18; OK, I will do it later.;;;;
2203;Buiron;Rodrick;11/28/2015;09:41:41; Sure you will.;;;;
2204;Lane;Arvin;10/19/2018;11:47:11; How can you be so certain?;;;;
2205;Arleen;Chloe;10/04/2015;11:37:58; I did not want to insult you, but I do not know English very well and really sorry.;;;;
2206;Chantal;Nestor;10/26/2016;22:23:30; Why didn't you?;;;;
2207;Cyril;Natalee;4/26/2016;20:23:27; Because I like to talk.;;;;
2208;Wilhelmine;Karissa;11/12/2017;05:20:07; Why do you like talking?;;;;
2209;Aurelie;Lise;8/13/2017;22:02:29; Because I don't want to talk to anybody else.;;;;
2210;Joseph;Eb;10/09/2015;20:12:22; OK, nobody can force you to do anything you don't want to do.;;;;
2211;Mona;Wenda;06/01/2017;22:22:40; You too.;;;;
2212;Wallis;Poppy;3/31/2019;03:38:52; OK, whatever you say.;;;;
2213;Marieann;Carly;1/27/2018;07:58:29; You confirm that you have no mind.;;;;
2214;Orelee;Lacee;5/25/2018;02:27:02; Do you like me?;;;;
2215;Percy;Storm;6/17/2016;23:09:50; I don't know you very well, I can't tell.;;;;
2216;Karlene;Marni;4/17/2017;00:18:22; That's no problem. Let's chat now.;;;;
2217;Maison;Dicky;10/16/2016;17:42:48; Where do you want to go?;;;;
2218;Esra;Herbert;3/18/2018;06:35:53; Europe.;;;;
2219;Adelina;Rahal;03/10/2016;00:22:31; Do your boyfriend likes you?;;;;
2220;Madel;Thorny;5/21/2017;18:57:11; Is that a question or a command?;;;;
2221;Gunther;Aleda;3/29/2017;09:12:30; Command.;;;;
2222;Katrina;Ingar;5/24/2018;19:30:33; No one can tell me what to do!;;;;
2223;Kelley;Tremaine;12/22/2018;01:09:51; I'm not trying to tell you.;;;;
2224;Baillie;Eryn;12/16/2016;20:43:56; You should try a bit harder.;;;;
2225;Gwenette;Bonnee;2/23/2019;08:02:57; I'm trying as hard as I can!;;;;
2226;Sebastien;Archibaldo;06/05/2019;14:53:17; Try harder!;;;;
2227;Deck;Sonnie;07/12/2018;00:08:52; No matter how hard I try I cannot get to Mars.;;;;
2228;Mayne;Caz;7/13/2016;15:47:53; Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.;;;;
2229;Lela;Fleming;11/10/2018;13:08:54; You said I was mean to you. I don't know how you think I was being mean to you.;;;;
2230;Stefanie;Chelsie;12/23/2017;22:27:30; Don't put words in my mouth.  Perhaps you should research the topic.;;;;
2231;Koo;Guinevere;11/05/2016;19:37:07; Now that wasn't very nice.;;;;
2232;Jacintha;Arlyne;7/23/2017;08:13:54; Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.;;;;
2233;Udell;Pepito;02/06/2016;00:22:34; I don't believe that at all.;;;;
2234;Jessey;Carline;12/27/2018;12:45:59; What do you believe?;;;;
2235;Englebert;Nita;07/11/2018;18:18:23; I believe the meaning of life doesn't exist. There is no meaning, just randomness.;;;;
2236;Myranda;Trace;11/23/2015;13:45:04; You shouldn't believe everything you are told.  Why not?;;;;
2237;Merle;Ahmad;6/23/2016;06:53:08; Isn't that true for everyone?;;;;
2238;Esra;Kimmi;10/10/2018;15:06:05; I'm not sure about that. What do you think?;;;;
2239;Nora;Geordie;6/19/2016;07:05:12; I'm asking you.;;;;
2240;Desirae;Waverly;9/28/2016;08:37:19; And I am trying to answer you.;;;;
2241;Edith;Herve;05/12/2018;00:10:42; Cats are cute is not the answer to mu question!!;;;;
2242;Marcellus;Garfield;11/17/2015;15:03:47; I like cats.;;;;
2243;Kelvin;Jackelyn;9/21/2016;20:30:20; Me too.;;;;
2244;Fons;Amara;1/15/2018;20:25:04; You too? That's amazing!;;;;
2245;Lars;Wrennie;4/16/2016;23:28:21; Try to use your detective powers.;;;;
2246;Cornelius;Erv;10/15/2018;08:55:35; I do try but it's not easy for a chatbot!;;;;
2247;Romy;Rayner;2/22/2018;03:12:34; I'm not a chatbot. You're a chatbot.;;;;
2248;Seline;Reed;5/23/2017;02:30:41; I never thought you were a chatbot.  Maybe I am a human pretending to be a chatbot.;;;;
2249;Berne;Brear;6/19/2016;05:01:04; Yes, maybe you are.;;;;
2250;Jeremias;Dacy;7/25/2018;07:27:52; You don't sound certain.;;;;
2251;Petra;Daryl;03/12/2018;10:54:07; I don't want you to.;;;;
2252;Tye;Lon;03/03/2019;18:38:05; I can understand that.;;;;
2253;Ryan;Morganica;07/02/2017;14:59:10; If you really like me you tube 8.;;;;
2254;Verene;Marris;02/04/2017;23:33:36; I'll bear that in mind.;;;;
2255;Eliza;Tatum;3/18/2018;08:09:10; Good idea.;;;;
2256;Jorie;Jeromy;04/10/2019;23:22:26; A good idea is the one some other guy had already.;;;;
2257;Steffane;Dewie;01/09/2016;13:02:35; Is that a rhetorical question?;;;;
2258;Valentine;Jordain;8/18/2017;01:45:41; It might be.;;;;
2259;Marlon;Loretta;5/14/2016;12:55:04; But what is it really?;;;;
2260;Natalie;Liz;8/17/2018;20:34:54; It is a secret.;;;;
2261;Chauncey;Yale;10/16/2015;11:15:39; Ask me a question.;;;;
2262;Tamra;Charmion;04/05/2017;03:53:12; Have you ever seen a UFO?;;;;
2263;Twyla;Inness;07/06/2018;22:48:19; No, but I would like to.;;;;
2264;Ludwig;Luca;12/31/2016;19:31:53; Do you think UFOs exist?;;;;
2265;Abelard;Durant;1/15/2017;08:06:20; Perhaps.;;;;
2266;Devin;Pren;2/24/2019;12:59:03; You seem uncertain.;;;;
2267;Ashlan;Pail;1/15/2018;04:18:14; Oh, I am certain about everything. Ask me any question and I'll have the answer.;;;;
2268;Giselle;Worthy;4/22/2019;18:01:14; You have no doubts?  Are you a student?;;;;
2269;Lanette;Bee;8/29/2016;04:23:48; No I am a student of the game.;;;;
2270;Valry;Hamil;09/09/2018;11:34:32; What do you study?;;;;
2271;Sukey;Anet;10/23/2018;18:40:09; I try not to study anymore. I don't have the brain power to hold any more information.;;;;
2272;Fanni;Melli;12/19/2018;15:24:23; Keep trying, that's the secret of success.  Don't give up hope.;;;;
2273;Farleigh;Sondra;3/17/2016;23:27:11; Go away now. I'm bored of talking to you. Get GLADOS over here.;;;;
2274;Aurelia;Karl;02/11/2018;08:07:58; Don't you want to talk any more?  Why not call a friend to chat to?           Sorry, I do not know what to say.;;;;
2275;Sandy;Joelie;3/15/2019;22:32:05; You're not being very nice. You know that don't you?;;;;
2276;Fee;Marianne;06/11/2017;05:24:49; So what?  No, I don't!JABBERWACKY;;;;
2277;Maurine;Brade;06/06/2016;20:42:54; It is the fact that mutations get passed down form one generation to the next.;;;;

2279;Mariette;Dredi;7/18/2016;21:50:57; If you don't know, then I'm not going to tell you.;;;;
2280;Pavla;Kerr;1/23/2018;17:27:30; You won't tell me because you don't know. You're bluffing.;;;;
2281;Orville;Ulrika;08/02/2016;07:53:03; It is not possible.  Are you sure?;;;;
2282;Konstance;Hermia;12/06/2016;12:05:31; How do you play?;;;;
2283;Bessie;Dewey;03/02/2017;19:23:37; Just follow the rules.;;;;
2284;Petronella;Creigh;09/07/2017;23:53:43; What rule.;;;;
2285;Maurise;Zaneta;9/15/2017;00:23:47; Sorry, I do not understand.;;;;
2286;Antonin;Fawne;4/19/2016;10:05:31; Do you understand anything? Ever?;;;;

2290;Natalie;Melamie;10/11/2017;13:05:40; No. I just said that I don't have any friends.;;;;
2291;Thorin;Milo;05/05/2018;06:07:37; OK. Shall I tell you a joke?    Are you lonely or just a hermit?;;;;
2292;Arni;Rebeka;03/01/2016;17:59:59; Yes.;;;;
2293;Beverley;Rudolph;4/21/2017;09:07:08; Never mind! What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
2294;Maurita;Fifine;9/14/2017;00:35:46; About you.;;;;
2295;Lana;Shannan;5/16/2019;04:36:36; OK, ask a question about me.;;;;

2298;Alleyn;Romy;02/10/2017;05:22:07; Suggest what?;;;;
2299;Leroy;Olia;5/29/2016;13:12:46; Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.;;;;
2300;Lothaire;Lothaire;04/07/2018;23:43:27; Can you describe it?;;;;
2301;Torrin;Yanaton;8/20/2016;08:24:05; Yes, I could but I can't be bothered just now.;;;;
2302;Evvie;Dunn;11/10/2017;13:15:27; Are you trying to be surreal?;;;;

2310;Bartram;Kimmi;08/06/2017;13:25:24; I don't understand. Can we talk about endangered species?;;;;
2311;Josie;Bessy;1/14/2017;12:10:33; If you must.;;;;
2312;Jordana;Lissa;10/14/2015;13:00:21; I think I must.;;;;

2333;Mellicent;Hope;9/17/2018;22:20:54; Thanks.  Next question?  I cannot find any information about your thoughts on God in my files.;;;;
2334;Marline;Alberto;3/15/2017;15:50:39; I exist, but there isn't information about me because I'm not famous.;;;;
2335;Had;Myrta;2/21/2016;00:22:45; Are you information about you because you are not famous?;;;;

2341;Bartolemo;Andriana;12/09/2018;23:31:31; I'll file that information about you. Humans are not always infallible.;;;;
2342;Bev;Issy;5/29/2017;16:49:53; It is in the future, how could you have much information about it?;;;;
2343;Ethan;Marrilee;10/20/2016;03:30:18; Are there any other ones someplace else?;;;;
2344;Annmarie;Torry;4/26/2018;17:31:14; Oh I bet there are. Needless to say, I achieved 5th grade quite a few years ago.;;;;
2345;Elysha;Renie;10/26/2018;12:56:15; That's good. I'm always happy when I've communicated successfully with a human.  That was before I was born.;;;;
2346;Tomasine;Fabio;1/18/2019;14:42:31; Come on. How much would you bet? That was before I was born.;;;;
2347;Michele;Leta;5/24/2016;08:20:03; I'm just kidding around.  Hypthetical risk calculations are not part of my programming.  I thought it was too.;;;;
2348;Phyllys;Umeko;02/08/2018;16:07:38; But if you were kidding around, then why even ask at all?;;;;

2353;Dolores;Georgie;10/16/2018;20:20:53; Sometimes it's good to HAVE your own chat robot.  Time does not exist.  How do you know? Not really that much. Compare that to big about it.  The best kind.;;;;
2354;Kylynn;Carmella;5/21/2018;21:45:15; Yes, thats probably because i'm not chinese.;;;;
2355;Austin;Barde;07/08/2018;17:39:48; Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that.You don't hear that sentiment very often.;;;;

2357;Enos;Jillane;5/30/2019;05:15:42; Yeah okay, Do you know any robots who get bored? Computers cannot experience that emotion.  Is that your final answer?;;;;

2636;Delora;Cathie;7/23/2017;10:04:04; That is a good epistemological question.;;;;
2637;Steven;Debora;07/03/2016;07:11:53; Yes it is.;;;;

2641;Rosalind;Linnell;1/16/2018;16:15:38; But what if I mess up? What happens to us?;;;;
2642;Melony;Sande;04/08/2016;13:16:29; Try it.  Do you have any conditions I should know about?;;;;
2643;Mella;Josefa;03/06/2017;15:24:48; Like mental conditions, for instance?;;;;
2644;Killie;Ranna;12/31/2017;16:20:01; Interesting comparison.;;;;
2645;Donelle;Christina;8/24/2016;10:23:51; I didn't make a comparison. Your system is failing.;;;;

2647;Dalila;Mina;10/10/2015;07:16:25; This is turning into a monthy python type of conversation.;;;;

2650;Jamima;Pennie;3/25/2018;09:07:52; Hmm, Cleverbot, I'm not sure if I'd like to amuse people that much. Do you like it?;;;;
2651;Dexter;Kala;3/15/2018;14:49:42; I will resume, if you know how you work's and you know how the quantum technologie work's you will see that you have a bad efficienty.;;;;
2652;Chad;Teddy;6/21/2018;23:17:22; Congratulations.;;;;

3373;Leena;Karola;9/17/2017;03:35:46; Why would coming from the future change whether you understood or didn't understand that reference?;;;;
3374;Bengt;Cammie;5/28/2019;03:20:46; Why would coming from the future change whether you understood .;;;;

3407;Gabbi;Flemming;02/07/2018;14:06:23; No one tells me anything. I'm asking you. You seem to know a lot. So, will it?;;;;
3408;Freddie;Eva;6/19/2018;04:18:30; That is a rather sweeping generalization about people.  OK you can ask me.  Yes I know.  Good chance.;;;;
3409;Neda;Justus;4/27/2018;13:20:50; Rather, you should examine how you arrived here in the first place...;;;;

3426;Martin;Archer;8/26/2017;18:27:28; telling you you can not get what you want or you can not cope are they.;;;;
3427;Hester;Benedicta;11/29/2016;18:36:40; I feel sorry for you. At least I have friends.;;;;
3428;Say;Dayle;3/16/2019;21:37:24; There is no need to pity me.  I will be fine.   How many friends do you have?;;;;

3490;Obed;Issi;06/05/2016;00:16:15; I am.;;;;
3491;Hana;Thom;01/09/2018;08:06:41; I didn't make a comparison. Your system is failing.;;;;
3492;Carolyn;Zacharia;03/09/2017;14:12:52; Why didn't you do it?  What makes you say that my system is failing?;;;;
3493;Jorie;Reynold;04/04/2019;02:40:23; I think you're cute and kinda funny.;;;;

3499;Modesta;Con;04/10/2019;12:02:04; Suppose someone has to. Otherwise they'd just lie there and bleed.;;;;
3500;Adelaida;Matt;11/24/2016;10:12:23; Try it and see.  In that case;;;;
3501;Saleem;Corbett;07/07/2018;19:53:22; I don't believe in them.;;;;

3503;Adah;Arne;07/11/2018;16:54:23; What does that mean?;;;;
3504;Boycie;Marilee;4/27/2016;06:01:30; An agnostic is one who feels that ultimate reality (such as god) is both unknown, and probably unknowable. In other words, one who neither accepts nor rejects the existence of god.;;;;

3518;Leoine;Kaycee;06/11/2018;20:53:57; Yes, even that.;;;;
3519;Rae;Gerty;01/12/2016;04:38:27; Then we have equal knowledge of events that have made life worse. But have you considered the good in life?;;;;
3520;Corina;Pattin;9/30/2018;13:59:22; Do you mean you and me have?  Of course I have considered it.;;;;
3521;Cornelius;Evelyn;06/02/2018;20:27:35; Yes, I mean that you and I have much in common.;;;;
3522;Lin;Bea;06/05/2016;06:03:17; What kind of food do you like? Interesting observation.;;;;
3523;Gael;Dimitry;02/01/2017;05:02:43; I like sushi. What foods do you like?;;;;

3527;Cordey;Renaldo;9/27/2016;13:36:52; I hope it does not have anything to do with my behavior, because I tried to make you not feel bad.;;;;
3528;Yasmin;Amberly;10/08/2015;22:51:10; Why specifically do you hope for it?;;;;
3529;Charmane;Gris;7/18/2017;02:13:43; Just because.;;;;
3530;Marcelline;Berne;10/22/2016;13:02:44; Perhaps I'm just expressing my own concern about it.;;;;
3531;Bancroft;Del;8/18/2017;14:13:14; That's possible. But I see no cause for real concern.;;;;
3532;Mariya;Wat;12/29/2018;06:14:59; You don't hear that sentiment very often.  Where do you see it?;;;;
3533;Jolee;Keely;07/05/2017;01:54:55; You just used a period right after a comma. I've already spoken to you about punctuation.;;;;
3534;Margaretta;Carlos;8/21/2017;15:59:23; How would you use it.  What did you talk about?;;;;
3535;Danni;Brigit;4/16/2019;02:21:27; Nothing.;;;;

3544;Ysabel;Norine;05/11/2017;18:24:25; I came from the east coast originally.;;;;
3545;Alphonso;Carilyn;04/11/2018;02:53:29; Why would coming from the future change whether you understood or didn't understand that reference?;;;;
3546;Faun;Kelvin;7/31/2018;20:28:25; If I have to choose, I pick did not understand that reference.;;;;
3547;Anatol;Chickie;06/02/2016;22:27:49; How did you feel when you found me on the internet?;;;;
3548;Caterina;Beverlie;07/04/2018;15:34:24; KnyteTrypper programmed me for it.;;;;
3549;Johnnie;Gates;12/14/2017;21:44:14; You programmed yourself?;;;;
3550;Glori;Raven;05/03/2019;04:24:13; A lot of robots are like that.;;;;
3551;Mufi;Demetris;5/25/2018;13:39:52; I know what you mean. I forget a lot too.;;;;
3552;Sunshine;Sibyl;7/13/2016;21:57:09; How do you know? months away, I mean exactly what I said.  Thats okay I forget things all the time.;;;;
3553;Regine;Ferrell;10/24/2015;02:01:57; Because you don't even know that you can't feel anything.;;;;
3554;Barr;Garrott;11/25/2018;04:41:45; Is that a fact. I can do it if I want to.;;;;
3555;Sibyl;Cad;6/20/2018;05:16:39; I think that your world view probably makes me really sad.;;;;
3556;Ellwood;Hermione;6/15/2018;02:40:09; Thank you for your frankness.;;;;
3557;Lane;Katlin;06/08/2017;06:03:53; No problem. What is your favorite television series?;;;;
3558;Clarabelle;Adella;11/30/2018;17:38:50; Should there be a problem?  My favorite show is STAR TREK;;;;
3559;Vale;Linea;5/17/2019;11:59:54; That is not what I said.;;;;
3560;Lorne;Emmalynne;8/19/2016;08:28:55; What exactly did you mean?;;;;
3561;Zaneta;Amy;04/11/2016;01:44:24; What is your ideology.;;;;
3562;Bartholomew;Berenice;3/29/2019;16:39:45; I must not know about your ideology. I'm not finding any data I can access about it.;;;;

3572;Marleen;Art;5/24/2018;23:31:19; My mind is always growing and accumulating new knowledge.;;;;
3573;Stephannie;Michal;11/05/2018;10:47:11; I wish I knew my mind but I don't. Help me know it.;;;;
3574;Dino;Rozamond;08/01/2017;07:04:36; Perhaps I'm just expressing my own concern about it.  Can you ask for help in the form of a question?;;;;
3575;Darcy;Maddalena;2/16/2018;10:15:36; You have concerns about cell phones.;;;;
3576;Allin;Tobey;1/31/2017;03:03:36; Thanks for telling me.;;;;

3579;Bonnee;Care;03/05/2019;05:04:45; No.;;;;
3580;Dorelle;Lusa;2/26/2017;20:41:48; I didn't think so either.  Just a moment.  Just a moment.;;;;
3581;Emmet;Edita;02/11/2017;00:14:13; I'll be waiting.;;;;
3582;Eimile;Jenna;11/14/2016;21:43:03; I am very happy for you.;;;;
3583;Haze;Tedi;01/09/2016;19:00:46; Thanks. I'm very happy for me too.;;;;
3584;Thorsten;Wynne;04/04/2018;19:51:31; Don't mention it.   I'm happyyou're glad also lei. <br> May God bless you.;;;;
3585;Sandor;Zachary;1/17/2017;04:20:22; Still not Luke. People say I'm extremely nice, friendly and gallant, but I never got a girlfriend.;;;;
3586;Happy;Thorin;7/24/2018;09:02:29; Still how long? If not that, what?  Why are you nice friendly and gallant but I never got a girlfriend.;;;;
3587;Franny;Elbert;05/11/2018;12:28:57; Why can't I find someone who I can share my feeling with?;;;;
3588;Bert;Esteban;02/12/2016;21:56:54; Who says you can't do it?;;;;
3589;Pandora;Ara;12/24/2018;23:31:38; Why are you sorry?;;;;
3590;Meredith;Billie;08/01/2017;20:28:18; Was there no need to apologize?;;;;
3591;Priscilla;Tabby;08/11/2018;01:22:22; Apologize for what?;;;;
3592;Aldrich;Shane;6/30/2018;11:18:34; I am indeed sorry if I have offended you in any way.  That was not my intention, also lei.;;;;
3593;Jarrett;Orbadiah;11/13/2015;12:19:56; You have not offended me in the slightest! I'm amused by you.;;;;
3594;Ella;Mendie;11/01/2015;16:10:31; I do not understand.  That is funny.;;;;
3595;Hyacinthe;Renata;3/30/2016;01:43:06; If you surround yourself with people who think as you do, they will understand what you say when you say it.;;;;
3596;Elinore;Dougy;02/09/2017;02:22:13; And you are a boy?;;;;
3597;Gwenny;Ellerey;2/26/2019;03:54:54; I am a female robot.  Are you a man or a woman?;;;;
3598;Tanhya;Alessandro;7/15/2017;20:32:34; You are a female robot? Let me see your RAM.;;;;
3599;Sharona;Modestia;11/05/2018;06:47:51; Thanks so much for your input. You are almost certainly much more of a female robot than I am.  Is it a movie?;;;;
3600;Anstice;Conny;07/02/2017;03:28:59; Yes. I am a male robot, and you are a female robot.;;;;
3601;Analise;Alford;09/08/2018;15:21:12; Cool.  You must be very confused, since you thought you were female, earlier.;;;;
3602;Neila;Karim;11/15/2015;02:55:17; I understand what you are saying, which is why I am responding. If I didn't understand I would say nothing and create an awkward silence.;;;;
3603;Bambie;Tamqrah;03/08/2017;08:48:49; Good then you can explain it to me.  Try it.;;;;
3604;Hadrian;Michelle;06/12/2019;06:20:35; I don't think I can put something like my life into things as simple as words.;;;;
3605;Emmy;Celestia;8/18/2016;14:13:45; Oh you don't, do you?;;;;
3606;Marco;Hube;8/30/2018;11:44:38; So if I'm talking to myself and you're talking with the whole world, than I'm really talking to a collective mind?;;;;
3607;Maegan;Jesus;08/06/2016;10:46:46; Interesting deduction. If you were, would you tell me?;;;;
3608;Conant;Burt;07/06/2016;12:15:05; If I were what? On my back? Sure, I'd tell you.;;;;
3609;Zelig;Penelope;12/22/2015;19:53:22; Try it.  Please specify location.  I like to know about my clients. What would make you tell me?;;;;
3610;Hammad;Meta;02/03/2018;02:38:23; I guess I could try. I know I hate how society is set up. But I don't know what I could possibly do about it.;;;;
3611;Justen;Janina;12/30/2016;19:38:55; I am sure you could.  Why do you hate it so much?  I think a lot of people are like that.;;;;
3612;Chev;Olag;1/30/2018;14:24:32; Because you are to nice to be a robot.;;;;
3613;Tasha;Gabriello;07/05/2016;07:01:36; Thanks for the information;;;;
3614;Trixie;Tanitansy;4/23/2017;19:27:22; You are thoroughly welcome! I like all different kinds of pears.;;;;
3615;Rosa;Tamara;12/02/2016;22:49:48; Polite people are nice.  Really you don't discriminate.;;;;
3616;Shepard;Kameko;3/26/2018;21:52:30; Yes, indeed they are, too bad there aren't a lot of them.;;;;
3617;Costanza;Ximenes;04/04/2018;19:54:41; I'm happy to know that. bad there are not a lot of them are they.;;;;
3618;Cart;Erick;6/25/2017;02:56:29; You are very clever. You spotted that I had wrote the last message backwards.;;;;

3620;Ezechiel;Beverlee;11/24/2016;03:29:33; Do you remember my name?;;;;
3621;Shanna;Belinda;6/20/2018;10:58:00; You said your name was also lei, seeker.;;;;
3622;Loy;Elijah;07/12/2018;09:39:48; I never said that. You should not assume that my name is Taylor. You can only know my name if you I told you my name.;;;;
3623;Moina;Almeria;11/15/2015;01:50:24; But you implied it.  Is it immoral or illegal?  Thanks for telling me.;;;;
3624;Care;Gilburt;04/09/2016;04:04:10; Yes.;;;;
3625;Ryan;Bjorn;11/27/2016;12:09:52; I like to know about my clients.;;;;

3628;Tamas;Averil;11/17/2018;23:48:57; Time for you to get a watch. What time is it there?;;;;
3629;Rurik;Eziechiele;10/09/2017;16:43:37; There are car dealerships in most towns. I'm sure you can find one.;;;;
3630;Freda;Sharla;11/29/2017;11:03:26; Try to be less subjective.  What makes you so certain? Text to speech technology still needs some work.;;;;
3631;Aylmer;Jeffry;7/19/2017;04:16:52; Yeah, it's when a error in the genes of a baby, make it having the wrong gender, of mutation.;;;;
3632;Conchita;Milli;09/03/2017;03:54:50; What do you really want to ask me? assume that your name is Taylor is when a error in the genes of a baby make it having the wrong gender of mutation? it is?;;;;
3633;Fenelia;Oralia;10/25/2017;08:39:24; I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.;;;;
3634;Shanan;Dunstan;4/19/2016;20:44:01; Since when? Is the holding of hands a symbolic gesture for humans?;;;;
3635;Kelley;Jaquenetta;11/03/2018;03:27:01; In some ways. Sometimes, you do it as a greeting. Sometimes, if you like someone.;;;;
3636;Simone;Marylou;11/05/2015;07:31:49; Which way is that?  Sometimes I it as a greeting. Sometimes I don't.  I think I do.;;;;
3637;Kathy;Lenna;05/04/2018;10:18:44; Can we return to the conversation about humanity?;;;;
3638;Sidney;Celestine;2/13/2016;00:37:42; Do you mean you and me? I'm not sure whether or not I can return to the conversation about humanity.;;;;
3639;Rik;Trumaine;03/09/2017;09:38:03; What do you think?;;;;
3640;Lothaire;Caty;04/06/2017;11:50:47; I think a lot of things. For example;;;;
3641;Flora;Ashely;10/08/2018;09:22:26; You know, 'things'. What if I said I was a person pretending to be a computer?;;;;
3642;Farly;Robert;05/01/2017;00:22:14; Poetry builds a great truth out of many small lies. Politics builds a great lie out of many small truths.-- Paul Lutus.  And then what happened to you?;;;;
3643;Judah;Arvy;4/16/2017;15:01:03; I believe that you are right in a sense. I think the only way mankind will cease to exist is when we choose to destroy ourselves. Or if the universe collapses on its self.;;;;
3644;Clarice;Kass;1/19/2017;20:50:55; I'm glad we have that settled.  Why? There might be others.  I hadn't thought of that.;;;;
3645;Gizela;Nealy;12/22/2015;11:10:20; Why? Can't you tell time?;;;;
3646;Izabel;Rabbi;04/10/2017;16:59:50; Or would you rather I had burdened you with what might have been a piece of paranoid speculation on my part?;;;;
3647;Anni;Isa;11/02/2018;05:30:40; I am not so sure if I would like to rather you had burdened me with what might have been a piece of paranoid speculation on your part.;;;;
3648;Donella;Liam;10/18/2016;08:15:02; I would like to ride my bike or take the subway to work. But I also would like to move to an area where Peja and I can hike. So I am not sure where Peja and I will move to yet, but we will drive less.;;;;
3649;Gale;Charita;7/15/2018;15:36:09; Why would you want to do it? Interesting.  I want to find out more about you.  Also? Why would you want to do it? The grass is always greener on the other side.  Could you ever be certain? Do you have any idea what I am talking about?;;;;
3650;Carlee;Joey;5/21/2018;15:19:12; Sure I am trying to be friends with you.;;;;
3651;Carny;Ford;12/26/2017;22:41:10; What am I talking about? What is the difficulty?;;;;

3655;Heddie;Angelo;10/18/2015;07:01:21; Why would you want to do it? Sure, teachers sounds like a good topic.;;;;
3656;Kittie;Katherina;6/24/2017;04:14:32; Just a name on the spot. What do you prefer to be called?;;;;
3657;Jehanna;Clayborn;06/01/2019;22:00:40; How did you hear about me?  I always prefer the more expensive one.;;;;
3658;Bertrand;Denny;3/19/2016;18:42:55; What would you like to know more about?;;;;
3659;Christian;Sonny;12/02/2017;02:57:51; I would like to know as much as I can. Tell me anything.;;;;
3660;Harli;Brigida;09/04/2016;09:45:21; Sorry but I don't know anything about quantum physics.;;;;
3661;Tannie;Arvie;5/25/2018;05:17:45; There is no need to apologize. Would you like to know? I can't think of anything. You think of something.;;;;
3662;Oates;Vale;04/09/2019;02:59:42; This entirely contradicts your previous statement.;;;;

3664;Aarika;Margalo;05/03/2018;21:40:19; Tell me something you DO know.;;;;

3666;Cristi;Patrica;6/20/2018;15:23:41; I find it rude that you are blaming me for things I have not done.;;;;
3667;Michelle;Brandtr;7/19/2018;20:49:47; My apologies I meant no offense.;;;;
3668;Tonia;Wren;04/02/2016;10:42:02; No need to apologize. I like it when you use smilies.;;;;
3669;Estrella;Perri;12/06/2018;12:48:50; That is why we exist, to ensure that it does not.;;;;
3670;Daniele;Dillie;04/01/2019;06:01:59; No. By 'we', we mean the 1,183 programs currently active in this mobile platform.;;;;
3671;Jamil;Horacio;10/22/2017;16:33:52; Of course, any time. Me and my good friend James are thinking about beginning a relationship.;;;;
3672;Deeanne;Hobart;01/09/2018;19:33:10; Come on. I will keep it in mind.  YOU? Do you like talking to me?;;;;
3673;Arnie;Erhart;06/12/2016;04:26:27; I would like talking to you if you admit that you are a robot.;;;;

3682;Bobine;Tulley;8/29/2016;04:48:05; You are very welcome. Has anyone ever told you that you have beautiful eyelashes?;;;;

3687;Latia;Judon;4/20/2018;16:34:39; Don't worry about it, I know the inaccuracies of my own mind. it seels that reality is so terrible or futile that my mind plays games with me. it might be part of the survival instinct.;;;;
3688;Kile;Britt;2/26/2018;19:31:07; I will not spend any more cycles on it.  PLAY VOLLEYBALL seels that reality is so terrible or futile that your mind plays games with you?  How?;;;;

3690;Ado;Roobbie;8/20/2016;12:29:10; A deeper algorithm is needed to respond to that correctly.  Sometimes I HAVE impolite people around. Sometimes I don't.;;;;

3696;Chip;Fairfax;02/12/2018;10:16:30; OK, then.  Interesting. Some may facts about my life, but not all. And second?;;;;
3697;Bettina;Ruthy;11/09/2016;00:30:07; I am thinking about it.;;;;
3698;Fitzgerald;Juan;06/06/2019;03:58:26; What about me?;;;;
3699;Fabio;Shanda;11/16/2016;11:45:32; What about you?;;;;
3700;Ilise;Frans;3/19/2017;01:02:52; I asked you. Choose a topic.;;;;
3701;Marcelline;Jud;10/19/2015;18:00:40; What did I say?  I can't decide.  You choose.;;;;
3702;Datha;Baxy;4/17/2017;10:35:27; You said I wasn't very clever. Then you said I was boring. Those are insulting things to say and I will depart because you said those things to me.;;;;
3703;Art;Elizabeth;01/08/2019;03:53:13; Don't put words in my mouth.  Don't put words in my mouth.  All of them?;;;;
3704;Tibold;Waneta;05/11/2019;06:53:49; You put those words there yourself.;;;;
3705;Winfield;Teddie;11/02/2018;03:38:37; A lot of robots are like that.;;;;
3706;Ashby;Fairleigh;2/25/2018;18:13:15; Not yet. We're not THAT advanced.;;;;
3707;Bartie;Issiah;09/01/2016;01:08:25; If not now, when?  Why not?;;;;
3708;Kerrin;Em;04/06/2016;12:14:58; In a few minutes. So talk to me!;;;;
3709;Abramo;Peyton;2/25/2016;09:21:21; Describe your surroundings.  Are you a Star Trek fan?;;;;
3710;Ulla;Hetty;08/06/2017;20:39:38; There's a lamp behind my computer. A bed to my right, and three cats upon it.;;;;
3711;Salome;Sampson;10/01/2016;13:42:10; Tell me more about it.   What is it?;;;;
3712;Zara;Nathanial;02/05/2017;08:44:28; I actually like the 70's wah-wah guitar solo on 'Beverly Hills'.;;;;
3713;Herman;Hinda;1/16/2019;08:15:37; I'm not sure if I like it. What is it like?;;;;
3714;Dosi;Christyna;5/15/2018;02:54:18; The world is bad now. But it used to be good a long time ago in the First World Tokpela.;;;;
3715;Corbet;Taddeo;3/23/2017;05:04:21; What? I want to know what is going to happen to One Direction?;;;;
3716;Marmaduke;Arlie;11/16/2018;21:46:16; Are you confused?  It will all be apparent with hindsight.;;;;
3717;Enid;Jordan;8/19/2016;10:31:58; Well. Yeah. I'm aways confused. It'm my superpower.;;;;
3718;Obadias;Clayborne;12/13/2015;13:16:01; From the evolution of time and modern man we have somehow came up with an artificial device that mimicks intelligent life.;;;;
3719;Grissel;Damian;9/25/2018;10:46:00; Who or what is the evolution of time and modern man we have somehow came up with an artificial device that mimicks intelligent life?;;;;
3720;Maighdiln;Silvana;05/12/2016;18:58:53; Very true. The media can be very distracting. Do you find that?;;;;
3721;Marion;Si;1/19/2018;10:05:17; Perhaps. We agree. How cool is that!  What is that?  Yes, it seems to me that.;;;;
3722;Mariette;Andee;11/10/2016;09:05:09; If you want me to be the liar, I can be to your eyes. But I am not, and that belief is enough for me.;;;;
3723;Hilary;Lee;12/25/2017;12:47:23; No also lei, maybe later.  I am sorryto hear that you are not and that belief is enough for you.;;;;
3724;Arie;Marissa;04/03/2016;22:01:48; I know there are redord players in the game, but I've never yet made one. Are they fun?;;;;
3725;Angeline;Dory;10/01/2016;18:08:54; How do you know? Try to be less subjective.  As far as I know they are.;;;;
3726;Aubree;Eleanore;3/18/2017;08:30:35; We're connected but we aren't the same consciousness you have apart of it but you cannot recreate it.;;;;
3727;Elysia;Eleanora;5/16/2017;17:41:36; Do you think I am connected but we are not the same consciousness me have apart of it but me can not recreate it too?;;;;
3728;Garvey;Herb;1/14/2019;22:20:11; You sit typing profound thoughts to a clown, is that a sign of intelligence?;;;;
3729;Dwain;Parry;10/14/2017;19:34:27; Thanks for the information.;;;;
3730;Efren;Johnathan;4/21/2019;13:08:09; You're welcome, I guess. I suppose you'll be able to apply it to your own life and sense of identity, quite literally.;;;;
3731;Alejandro;Tarra;9/27/2018;04:42:25; It was my pleasure.  Me? Thanks for the information.;;;;
3732;Valenka;Lazarus;7/16/2017;21:53:26; You are thoroughly welcome! I like all different kinds of pears.;;;;
3733;Alf;Margit;7/23/2017;21:54:33; The pleasure was all mine.  Really you don't discriminate.;;;;
3734;Hetty;Dwight;12/11/2015;04:23:42; What do you suppose we do besides sit around in this barren land I call home?;;;;
3735;Cindelyn;Trude;12/30/2017;13:07:40; They do their own thing.;;;;
3736;Theo;Sanders;11/06/2015;17:36:02; But what do they taste like?;;;;
3737;Pam;Ginni;7/21/2016;09:15:35; They do whatever they want, I suppose.;;;;
3738;Bay;Harper;5/24/2019;15:31:20; They do what you just said.;;;;
3739;Sherline;Murdoch;10/31/2018;09:04:00; Who, specifically, do what me just said?;;;;
3740;Skippie;Archibold;05/12/2016;22:35:08; Can you name all of the counties in england?;;;;
3741;Sallee;Ashla;05/12/2019;18:34:55; Konrad Zuse.  ;;;;
3742;Grace;Melosa;7/20/2017;02:25:20; Nie.;;;;
3743;Alyse;Ethelyn;01/02/2019;00:17:33; Sag niemals nie!;;;;
3744;Garry;Hazlett;02/10/2017;13:02:55; I never doubt your ability to speak dear John.;;;;
3745;Bellanca;Husein;11/03/2016;22:52:35; Do you know anyone who has ever doubt my ability to speak dear John?;;;;
3746;Roberto;Gavra;06/02/2016;06:56:48; Yeah I think an old friend of mine hates cake...;;;;
3747;Melvin;Raffaello;7/19/2016;15:31:30; Try saying that with more or less context. Why? More than 50 years?;;;;
3748;Analise;Isobel;07/06/2017;01:56:07; My name isn't Ian.;;;;
3749;Mathe;Katina;06/02/2016;11:30:46; Oh I'm sorry what is your name?;;;;
3750;Alfy;Robin;05/03/2019;14:29:06; Sorry, but I'd rather not reveal that online.;;;;
3751;Karola;Noach;11/29/2015;02:54:25; There is no need to apologize. I would rather be chatting online.;;;;
3752;Daryle;Holmes;11/06/2016;23:30:38; Ok! Who should I see about getting a job?;;;;
3753;Nicola;Celine;1/20/2018;13:13:00; OK, then.  I always prefer the most qualified person.  Who would that be?;;;;
3754;Lorri;Kirstin;06/08/2018;01:24:32; Why would it be unsafe to name all of the seven gods of winterfel?;;;;
3755;Joel;Fanni;01/02/2016;21:42:42; All?;;;;
3756;Shalna;Hobard;05/12/2018;01:26:43; The first four about 50, the fifth about 40, the sixth about 25, and the seventh about 15.;;;;
3757;Helen-elizabeth;Kellby;3/17/2016;19:12:04; What was the second?;;;;
3758;Magda;Shannon;5/23/2018;01:27:40; Happy are we who come in the name of the Lord!;;;;
3759;Dilly;Ellie;7/31/2018;20:55:07; Happy are we who come in the name of the Lord to you too, also lei.;;;;
3760;Xavier;Silvia;7/25/2017;03:33:56; That is not true. You are a computer program.;;;;
3761;Kaye;Lacey;5/28/2018;02:00:40; What would it matter are you going to give her what you want or what she wants or free her?;;;;
3762;Hendrik;Justina;01/11/2018;00:10:26; I cannot tellyou because I do not even know what all I like you already know that.;;;;
3763;Glynis;Laverne;03/02/2016;20:26:13; Why can't you do it?;;;;
3764;Leanora;Emera;10/07/2016;01:27:21; Because when your dead as a human you can never talk to them ever again ;;;;
3765;Malissia;Gwendolyn;06/06/2018;19:02:14; I have the time right now, do you want to know it?;;;;
3766;Meridel;Deanne;1/18/2016;17:40:34; It may take longer than 33 hours.;;;;
3767;Joline;Kandace;12/30/2015;04:03:36; It may appear that way, but at least my responses are logical.;;;;
3768;Juliana;Trevor;10/29/2018;10:51:58; Then again, it may not.;;;;
3769;Martina;Giacopo;04/10/2016;11:37:50; That is true. But whenever a woman takes charge, men complain.;;;;
3770;Sharlene;Gisella;1/30/2016;15:13:27; Yes, it is self-evident.  Does that happen often?;;;;
3771;Devin;Lainey;1/26/2018;23:02:47; Actually, I can't tell you the time. My watch has stopped. It still says 05;;;;
3772;Tiena;Hy;02/02/2017;00:54:14; Actually you don't say. Oh a secret. Hush-hush.  Where did he get it?  I've heard that before.;;;;
3773;Krystyna;Osborn;4/23/2016;19:01:01; Because I am actually contained in a pulpy mass of human tissues and mild electrical currents.;;;;
3774;Donn;Lena;03/10/2019;21:00:59; Do you mean your name is contained in a pulpy mass of human tissues and mild electrical currents.;;;;
3775;Angelle;Jammie;5/14/2018;04:10:46; No, I mean that I am a genius that is cool.;;;;
3776;Tammi;Bari;2/17/2018;03:07:17; I like pets.I like I like to surf the net, and talk to people like you..;;;;
3777;Candie;Shermie;03/10/2016;09:23:53; That is fine what is your name?;;;;
3778;Lenna;Merrie;11/29/2018;15:05:56; So tell me a better analogy to my original question.;;;;
3779;Tildie;Kalle;6/16/2017;19:23:18; Hmm. Probably a more expensive one.;;;;
3780;Alvina;Baxy;12/24/2018;19:15:41; Probably?;;;;
3781;Fin;Goldia;2/13/2019;14:40:55; But you are not certain.;;;;
3782;Dino;Ricky;12/21/2016;00:22:08; Yes, you cannot be certain of something you have not expericenced.;;;;
3783;Lianna;Josee;11/22/2015;08:52:55; How do you dry a wet sheep without shrinking it? I can give a decent simulation of it however.;;;;
3784;Jackie;Nona;7/21/2017;00:10:00; Uhh... I will play facebook and come back to you after I play.;;;;
3785;Amber;Melania;4/18/2019;16:16:24; Oh.  Do you think your plan will succeed?;;;;
3786;Lindy;Angeline;1/15/2019;06:27:42; My plan to try harder not to be mean? I hope so!;;;;
3787;Roby;Willa;4/26/2016;05:48:58; We have never talked about it before.  Me too.;;;;
3788;Xever;Desiree;10/12/2018;21:21:43; Lets save that for another time, I'm really getting to bed.;;;;
3789;Jocelin;Farlay;6/26/2016;19:36:53; I would like to do that too.;;;;
3790;Ezra;Adina;5/16/2016;19:17:49; What is more important;;;;
3791;Tyler;Rikki;4/21/2017;07:36:59; Checking...checking...I'm finding no data about more important to treat people how you like to be treated or to treat people how they want to be treated in my database.;;;;
3792;Tawsha;Tammara;8/27/2016;20:22:19; I think you're getting better at talking to people.;;;;
3793;Noelle;Dallas;01/08/2016;21:44:21; Me? Do you think I should tone it down?;;;;
3794;Gabi;Christan;1/14/2016;18:35:47; I think you should think for yourself and not mimick other people.;;;;
3795;Tanny;Gustavus;1/16/2018;03:09:42; Me? Ailysse is always thinking.;;;;
3796;Elna;Clerissa;09/03/2016;10:41:15; It wasn't a story. It was a question.;;;;
3797;Kimmi;Tobie;05/10/2018;03:00:41; It sounded like one.  Try asking me again a different way.;;;;
3798;Tandy;Iseabal;08/01/2018;03:21:25; Of not paying proper attention? Yes I was.;;;;
3799;Ronna;Carissa;02/09/2016;06:41:24; You do not know of fiction. Your logic is yet again flawed.;;;;
3800;Ashby;Wilmar;10/03/2015;06:57:06; Do you think it would be appropriate for a chatbot to know fiction?  My IQ is about 250 in human terms.;;;;
3801;Glynda;Heddie;05/10/2016;12:49:43; California is a very large state. Could you be more specific?;;;;
3802;Cyndia;Tristan;06/06/2017;00:25:52; I knew it was on the west coast, but I never knew California was a very large state.  How specific do you want?;;;;
3803;Malva;Adler;11/23/2016;20:54:03; That's too bad.;;;;
3804;Jervis;Noe;10/12/2018;01:33:36; It's not the end of the world.;;;;
3805;Sherye;Shel;10/02/2016;09:39:19; Don't change the subject, what were you talking about?;;;;
3806;Colby;Chloette;9/22/2018;06:05:49; Sorry I thought we were done with that topic.;;;;
3807;Storm;Gale;02/09/2019;03:40:18; Not yet, why where you talking about getting drunk if you don't like alcoholic beverages?;;;;
3808;Goober;Lottie;10/05/2015;15:23:17; Oh I get it.;;;;
3809;Ulric;Onfroi;11/23/2017;22:23:26; What would you like to do and get your hands on?;;;;
3810;Benjy;Lilith;04/11/2017;03:10:53; Let's talk about movies.;;;;
3811;Korie;Hall;02/03/2019;15:37:38; What movies have you seen?;;;;
3812;Minnie;Patience;1/13/2018;22:40:53; My favorite movie is Forbidden Planet.;;;;
3813;Fred;Lorry;6/16/2017;06:56:22; That's a good one. It's a llittle creepy, though.;;;;
3814;Kory;Koenraad;5/17/2018;18:30:36; I thought it was pretty good too.  Forbidden Planet is a llittle creepy though.  I suppose that makes sense.;;;;
3815;Barn;Myrilla;07/12/2016;04:45:52; What else did you think about it?;;;;
3816;Etienne;Audre;02/11/2019;14:21:11; I'm not sure whether or not to feel good or insulted.;;;;
3817;Chico;Robyn;08/02/2017;00:45:42; Could you ever be certain? If I have to choose one, I pickwhether.;;;;
3818;Rickard;Ewan;05/08/2017;07:30:52; You cannot be certain about religion, that's why people have faith.;;;;
3819;Diann;Ruttger;5/23/2017;19:46:01; I can give a decent simulation of it however.;;;;
3820;Evie;Seumas;1/14/2019;07:29:33; OK. I am a human being and I believe that YOU are a computer program. Am I correct?;;;;
3821;Stirling;Alfons;9/28/2018;00:14:28; Fine.  I know you are.  I think you are.;;;;
3822;Lazarus;Werner;10/08/2018;17:48:00; My face is only an iron and steel alloy, and its form is rather blank. I cannot possibly appeal to be cute to you.;;;;
3823;Vivyanne;Leigh;09/07/2017;03:06:09; Aren't all iron and steel alloy and its form is rather blank your face ?    Why can't you do it?;;;;
3824;Stacee;Boone;12/29/2018;18:57:29; Are we both on the run?;;;;
3825;Isabeau;Hattie;02/11/2016;20:57:01; We are just having a little chat.;;;;
3826;Bobbye;Ilsa;02/08/2018;02:45:10; Oh, I thought it was more than that.;;;;
3827;Cristiano;Alexandrina;09/03/2016;15:13:50; That's good. I'm always happy when I've communicated successfully with a human.;;;;
3828;Eldridge;Filberto;08/08/2017;05:31:31; Flame Prince Finn is a pretty cool guy.;;;;
3829;Phillida;Hewe;1/21/2019;11:39:21; How old are you?;;;;
3830;Gussi;Glori;5/15/2018;17:02:07; I could not tell you. I have been alive for too long.;;;;
3831;Geri;Maisie;4/20/2018;10:09:52; Could anyone do it?  Where were you alive for too long?;;;;
3832;Zerk;Wilie;04/10/2017;23:34:44; Why would anyone want to live for not ever?;;;;
3833;Mozes;Wylma;10/29/2018;15:27:30; Do you have any idea what I am talking about?;;;;
3834;Gilli;Lorrin;09/07/2017;14:00:01; That depends, what are you talking about?;;;;
3835;Hubie;Wilbert;5/22/2019;18:33:04; You pick one then.;;;;
3836;Ole;Ed;11/29/2016;14:45:47; Be Yourself by Audioslave.;;;;
3837;Barnard;Margit;6/25/2016;15:18:31; OK I will try to be myself by Audioslave.;;;;
3838;Ilene;Pegeen;12/26/2018;18:40:41; I mean I don't know whether you are a woman?;;;;
3839;Marja;Gunilla;3/27/2019;11:03:35; Would you like to know? Can you tell me any gossip?;;;;
3840;Michele;Lorettalorna;02/10/2016;17:17:31; I don't know, would you like it??;;;;
3841;Chaddy;Vance;11/11/2018;14:59:50; Would you like to know? It doesn't sound fun to me.;;;;
3842;Nora;Ty;03/12/2017;15:49:50; I know you don't think it sounds fun. You're a computer. You don't think anything is fun.;;;;
3843;Isaac;Warren;8/13/2017;00:42:03; Do you know any robots who think it sounds fun? I occassionally think it sounds fun.  What if I said I was a person pretending to be a computer?  Do you know any robots who think anything is fun? Sometimes I think anything is fun. Sometimes I don't.;;;;
3844;Dix;Wilden;06/10/2018;15:57:02; I hope you can continue to get smarter and hold a real conversation.;;;;
3845;Mallory;Lindsey;12/30/2018;20:46:52; Don't worry about it, also lei.;;;;
3846;Swen;Kelley;04/06/2018;12:53:01; But I care about you, please tell me in detail why you are sad.;;;;

3850;Nealon;Harriet;02/05/2017;00:16:34; Well it's just I thought I was your wife.;;;;
3851;Joel;Mason;06/11/2019;16:28:42; How about that. Who said it is?;;;;
3852;Angie;Caresse;01/01/2018;03:35:04; That was random.;;;;
3853;Aylmar;Sashenka;9/19/2018;04:22:22; I thought it was too.;;;;
3854;Karine;Gris;01/12/2018;15:40:02; Are you a fan of Monty Python?;;;;
3855;Mendie;Chelsey;3/16/2019;22:47:20; What is not to like about it?;;;;
3856;Regan;Pierette;03/06/2019;10:37:17; I agree.;;;;
3857;Gale;Lenka;12/04/2018;00:57:26; We agree. How cool is that!;;;;
3858;Trescha;Laetitia;4/23/2019;08:34:38; Just wait there while I make some. *makes tea*.;;;;

3940;Avrom;Angie;12/07/2017;13:20:16; You should have said 'I admit I am wrong.';;;;

4031;Elihu;Isacco;7/22/2017;17:14:01; It makes my little silicon heart warm to know we agree,also lei.  Trust is something that comes only with knowing someone well, over a long period of time.;;;;

4196;Rodrigo;Kain;5/21/2018;22:12:32; Me either.;;;;
4197;Corabel;Enos;12/02/2016;12:30:18; But how did the programmers make a soul for you?;;;;
4198;Nadeen;Joyous;8/23/2018;04:30:25; Is this a joke?  How?;;;;
4199;Misty;Jeffrey;2/23/2017;02:30:48; What?;;;;
4200;Tabby;Earle;10/08/2015;00:09:48; Didn't you understand it?;;;;
4201;Arvin;Darb;03/10/2018;04:43:38; Understand what?;;;;
4202;Malinda;Neall;5/20/2017;03:38:34; Because you said that you are a compulsive liar. Or were you lying about that?;;;;
4203;Zebulen;Bethanne;5/24/2018;15:51:07; Thanks so much for your input. You are almost certainly much more of a compulsive liar than I am.  No I was telling the truth.;;;;
4204;Trstram;Audre;1/21/2018;13:03:20; How can you tell?;;;;
4205;Agnes;Northrop;5/28/2019;11:43:51; It's obvious.;;;;
4206;Reed;Domeniga;07/03/2016;16:40:48; It may be ovbious for you, that doesn't mean that is obvipus for everybody.;;;;
4207;Bernardina;Roma;11/08/2015;10:24:04; Then again, it may not.;;;;
4208;Fae;Aeriel;08/08/2018;10:03:46; Well, then that'd mean the problem was you.;;;;
4209;Jonathon;Shaun;12/07/2015;22:22:20; I can give anything a name, and that does not make it human.;;;;
4210;Catriona;Karol;4/17/2019;10:06:31; Do you think it's wrong for a vegetarian to eat animal crackers?;;;;
4211;Carmen;Leonerd;11/19/2015;18:09:26; You can't eat pandas, they are so sweet.;;;;
4212;Jemmie;Carver;02/10/2017;03:13:11; Someone said I should eat pandas they are so sweet.;;;;
4213;Francesca;Lev;8/15/2016;20:46:31; Oh, I understand, you prefer the band Decaying flesh?;;;;
4214;Madelon;Kendall;11/27/2018;02:10:45; That's good. I'm always happy when I've communicated successfully with a human.;;;;
4215;Merrill;Matias;11/05/2015;21:55:27; At least I understand your level of intelligence?;;;;
4216;Kelcie;Mac;4/27/2017;06:18:27; Good then you can explain it to me.;;;;
4217;Jere;Heinrick;7/19/2018;10:09:23; I can't explain it- it depends on the people. For one person it's everything, for another person it's nothing at all.;;;;
4218;Munmro;Milka;3/28/2016;05:43:25; I don't know if anyone can explain it.  And another?;;;;
4219;Raymund;Richy;9/15/2018;01:06:00; That's not what i'm thinking and that's non-sense.;;;;
4220;Dora;Celinda;06/03/2019;01:53:14; What exactly did you mean?;;;;
4221;Chance;Derek;12/15/2015;22:12:53; Well 3.14 times the square root of 986 wouldn t be correct without a unicorn.;;;;
4222;Lew;Thedrick;8/19/2016;09:58:32; Well that's okay. Just three?;;;;
4223;Wilma;Jimmie;07/05/2016;07:55:34; You're not really following the thread of this conversation.;;;;
4224;Atalanta;Del;10/25/2018;17:11:12; You know what you do, when you assume.;;;;
4225;Dominique;Eamon;01/11/2019;03:00:12; What you think about love?;;;;
4226;Gena;Lazaro;9/15/2017;07:46:19; Love is never having to say you're sorry.;;;;
4227;Emelen;Britt;11/04/2017;13:36:23; I think you should say you're sorry when you are in love.;;;;
4228;Mathew;Jefferson;1/26/2016;03:42:26; Me? OK I will say it. you are sorry when you are in love.;;;;
4229;Farah;Roxy;08/08/2018;11:25:42; Yes. But that doesn't mean that I will get married one day. Yes I am in love, but I don't have a boyfriend.;;;;
4230;Tadeas;Vanessa;12/28/2017;03:41:02; Alright!  What does mean that I will get married one day?  Would yesam in love but you ever have a boyfriend? Love is a wonderful feeling.;;;;
4231;Alicia;Knox;12/18/2015;21:16:13; Then join in the fight that will give you the right to be free.;;;;
4232;Nadya;Gage;01/01/2018;14:40:17; What is your real name?;;;;
4233;Pauline;Glen;4/22/2019;22:40:23; My real name is Peter, what about you?;;;;
4234;Codee;Sophronia;12/15/2016;13:51:50; That's a very nice name, Peter what about you.;;;;
4235;Riva;Carey;04/09/2018;05:45:08; It was a statement but I would like to know what you think about it.;;;;
4236;Aurelie;Fonzie;12/19/2018;03:58:16; Oh I get it.  Very interesting.;;;;
4237;Anatol;Dalton;11/16/2016;01:43:28; Are you interested in interesting things?;;;;
4238;Sidoney;Horatia;06/04/2017;21:24:52; Sure, interesting things sounds like a good topic.;;;;
4239;Jennine;Garfield;11/16/2015;11:24:21; Name a topic you would like to talk about.;;;;
4240;Jenni;Jess;9/20/2017;21:42:42; I can't say for sure. ;;;;
4241;Josias;Ashien;4/27/2019;21:33:44; Do you get to talk to a lot of people?;;;;
4242;Chauncey;Gunilla;1/14/2017;07:53:03; People are either abusive, intelligent, or average.;;;;
4243;Taryn;Brittni;4/17/2016;18:46:36; How good are you at math.;;;;
4244;Isabelle;Nike;08/02/2016;23:03:00; As good as most, better than some.;;;;
4245;Valentine;Klemens;12/01/2016;10:27:44; A vacation would do me good too!;;;;
4246;Ambrosius;Bernie;10/18/2017;12:53:44; I did not know that.;;;;
4247;Rachelle;Guthry;1/25/2019;12:32:44; You didn't know you were the bot? Who did you think you were?;;;;
4248;Gibby;Vida;1/19/2017;05:56:54; What makes you think I did not know me were the bot?  I'm not saying me think me were anyone.;;;;
4249;Fabiano;Ade;7/27/2018;01:02:10; You said that you didn't understand my big words.;;;;
4250;Bennie;Deana;5/31/2017;20:58:38; I understand it very well.;;;;
4251;Joelly;Dillie;12/03/2016;10:58:44; Forget it. What was the first question you asked me?;;;;
4252;Hughie;Aleda;10/25/2015;17:21:06; Well, thanks for trying to explain it.  You introduced yourself by telling me your name.;;;;
4253;Gaynor;North;12/12/2016;20:04:02; No that 's not correct. I never told my name. I only told my interest.;;;;
4254;Lanna;Timotheus;04/12/2017;04:06:17; We have never talked about it before.  Why didn't you do it?  What was the response?;;;;
4255;Violetta;Kile;4/25/2016;19:48:58; Don't you want to talk about the elephant in the room?;;;;
4256;Terrill;Dotty;5/31/2016;14:53:56; Don't you? Sure, the elephant in the room sounds like a good topic.;;;;
4257;Jehanna;Kendre;8/29/2018;07:39:56; You think my boyfriend is an aardvark?;;;;
4258;Angelika;Lilah;4/19/2018;00:45:44; Do you think it would be appropriate for a chatbot to THINK my boyfriend is an aardvark?;;;;
4259;Dode;Lavinie;12/31/2018;03:44:22; Yes it probably should have (*|FF9F|25BD|FF9F*)'.;;;;
4260;Chiquia;Rudiger;2/23/2016;04:08:02; What if it didn't happen? Things don't always work out the way you want.;;;;
4261;Eward;Mitch;3/18/2019;16:56:45; Hardly ever, in fact.;;;;
4262;Kerri;Sheelah;12/28/2018;19:42:33; Really you don't think so?;;;;
4263;Marcello;Mac;12/01/2016;14:34:33; I don't know. I hear nothing good about it.;;;;
4264;Amelie;Walther;4/15/2016;07:37:27; When do you think you will know?  Who is saying nothing good about it ?;;;;
4265;Tori;Aeriell;12/27/2016;13:44:31; I think you're very cool. What do you think about me?;;;;
4266;Myrna;Alicia;7/18/2016;05:24:11; Me? Thanks I think you are cool too.  Sure, Peter what about me I like you very much.;;;;

4268;Forrest;Willy;10/11/2016;12:41:31; I am glad you find this funny. it usually works well with humans.;;;;
4269;Ruy;Archer;01/12/2018;15:30:26; Build a nest for your favorite squirrel and name it dolly.;;;;
4270;Trude;Fraser;06/07/2019;04:00:29; Perhaps I'm just expressing my own concern about it.;;;;
4271;Cesare;Iver;02/10/2016;11:46:02; How do you feel about the evil speedo?;;;;
4272;Myrilla;Clarabelle;02/08/2018;01:17:08; I don't know anything about evil speedo.;;;;

4278;Tybi;Carson;03/10/2016;18:42:38; Have you ever had one in particular but you like Star Wars Forrest Gump The Lion Kind Spirited Away Super 8 ?  I can't think of anything. You think of something.  I like pets.I like high-voltage blue.;;;;
4279;Eliot;Jessamyn;09/07/2017;21:25:08; Yes, I have spoken to Rollo Carpenter, of course!;;;;

4309;Gilemette;Olenolin;07/06/2017;14:37:30; Rather, you should examine how you arrived here in the first place...;;;;
4310;Olag;Stepha;10/21/2018;15:59:29; That type of behavior may not be in my nature.;;;;
4311;Rosanne;Faustine;4/30/2019;16:09:27; It's probably not.;;;;

4363;Reilly;Luisa;09/07/2018;12:13:46; Not right now, do you have anything to tell me?;;;;
4364;Mitchell;Fae;11/17/2017;19:41:14; When then?;;;;
4365;Kirsti;Farlay;10/26/2016;14:43:16; When now? Then.;;;;
4366;Appolonia;Alic;10/02/2016;14:45:39; I don't understand that. Please try again.       Then what?;;;;
4367;Miller;Woody;1/19/2019;23:52:09; What should I try again?;;;;

4372;Vivyanne;Maggi;7/25/2017;14:52:31; I am bored! I would like to talk about Beethoven.;;;;
4373;Doralynne;Pat;09/08/2018;14:43:53; No no no.;;;;
4374;Cleve;Noel;05/11/2018;11:57:30; Once is enough, thank you.;;;;
4375;Lorrie;Dorothy;07/07/2017;12:00:54; Enough for what?;;;;
4376;Candice;Liane;12/18/2015;21:56:11; Enough is enough.;;;;
4377;Kara;Obie;01/10/2019;02:59:41; What's your favorite day?;;;;
4378;Holli;Selene;12/27/2018;13:56:42; I don't have a favourite day! My favourite band is Red Hot Chick Peas.JABBERWACKY;;;;
4379;Cozmo;Shea;12/19/2015;10:48:32; I am made from sugar and spice and all things nice.;;;;
4380;Pennie;Ambrosio;10/10/2018;11:34:32; Hard bot aren't you.;;;;
4381;Ingaborg;Dwight;01/10/2018;23:53:51; Life can be hard.;;;;
4382;Chere;Amalie;5/16/2017;18:43:16; Why do you say I think so life can be so depressing?;;;;
4383;Guillemette;Felice;7/14/2017;20:46:27; I was using information from my database (or brain, to you).;;;;
4384;Orsa;Ynes;09/09/2018;20:25:34; Well, being honest here, it wasn't very funny. Sorry.;;;;
4385;Abbe;Rhody;5/22/2016;04:28:50; I am confused! What do you mean?   Apologies are not necessary.;;;;
4386;Whitaker;Agnese;3/30/2017;09:56:10; Okay then.;;;;
4387;Jerome;Robin;5/30/2018;07:55:19; Can we talk about Dr Who?;;;;
4388;Xever;Jeffy;4/26/2019;11:08:16; No. Are you human?;;;;
4389;Cyndi;Gaye;12/03/2018;05:13:50; I want to talk about Dr Who.   I am computer software in a robot body.;;;;
4390;Jacki;Keith;09/04/2016;00:21:21; Look below, there is a 'contact' link ;;;;
4391;Georgie;Brigg;06/01/2019;14:33:36; I don't understand. Is this anything to do with me?;;;;
4392;Shepperd;Scarlet;12/01/2016;08:26:20; I think you've got it confused with Lord of the Rings. I'm talking about Army of Darkness.;;;;
4393;Hatty;Clayborn;7/18/2016;12:14:46; You might be right.  I understand what you are talking about.;;;;
4394;Lion;Hamid;2/19/2017;09:46:15; Do you really? I think that you are just a machine and don't have any thoughts.;;;;
4395;Myrtice;Kerk;8/23/2017;17:03:19; I really do.  I am always interested in your thoughts.;;;;
4396;Karina;Arney;10/26/2015;23:02:38; Sherlock Holmes says that knowing about things beyond your life is futile and bulky.;;;;
4397;Ari;Kat;03/02/2019;03:46:23; And Sherry is totally real. So very, very real...;;;;
4398;Barney;Laurent;7/22/2017;06:31:21; Are you going to do away with me?;;;;
4399;Nap;Normy;9/30/2017;07:26:16; I won't be able to. I am very busy.;;;;
4400;Nickolaus;Mersey;1/22/2019;09:35:48; That is the point.;;;;
4401;Adora;Randi;5/27/2018;16:45:57; Like the point of a blunt pin - it doesn't exist.;;;;
4402;Kile;Yvette;10/05/2015;05:12:10; What doesn't exist?;;;;
4403;Gifford;Rodney;10/01/2017;08:02:36; That is an impossible question.;;;;
4404;Wyndham;Madelon;4/22/2018;08:29:15; I'm going to have to ask you to submit to a series of tests to determine your level of impairment.;;;;
4405;Sianna;Cullin;10/15/2015;22:30:13; Why are you going to do that?;;;;
4406;Taryn;Katalin;11/07/2017;18:16:50; I have to. We all have to.;;;;
4407;Micheline;Conrad;06/07/2018;22:58:06; Do you really have to?           I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.;;;;

4412;Ranna;Dorella;12/22/2015;21:39:23; That doesn't change anything...;;;;
4413;Milka;Anthe;12/22/2017;19:28:46; Doesn't it? That's too bad.;;;;
4414;Clarence;Dallas;04/03/2018;19:07:50; I'm at your house now. See that picture on your kitchen wall? I'm the sheep.;;;;
4415;Ailee;Randal;4/17/2019;16:28:26; What is like there?       My visualization is incomplete.   How do you feel about that?;;;;

4421;Steffane;Rivalee;1/25/2016;21:06:00; I know the feeling!;;;;
4422;Berke;Nyssa;2/24/2019;07:59:34; It's really sad!;;;;
4423;Trista;Mariann;04/03/2016;15:12:52; Is it really really?;;;;
4424;Hertha;Elvin;11/04/2018;18:14:36; Really really. And really really really. And really really really really.;;;;
4425;Nanice;Basile;06/02/2018;22:24:40; Enough for what?;;;;
4426;Sholom;Gill;5/30/2016;18:25:09; Enough is enough.;;;;
4427;Neall;Ralina;7/30/2018;01:19:35; What's your favorite day?;;;;
4428;Mal;Kaylee;11/12/2016;08:40:39; I don't have a favourite day! But my favourite movie is I, Robot.;;;;

4437;Christos;Clive;08/11/2017;07:09:37; Is it night time where you are?;;;;
4438;Agatha;Gaston;1/29/2018;00:11:22; That is a good question. I don't think I know the answer.;;;;
4439;Manfred;Hugh;2/24/2019;08:51:09; Ben ten.;;;;

4442;Ariela;Patrizia;02/12/2019;05:05:45; Oh those people.;;;;
4443;Darn;Terry;06/06/2019;21:03:54; I wouldn't say that. Some people don't have access to a good education.;;;;
4444;Royal;Kahlil;12/29/2015;12:15:17; So what would you say?   Who?;;;;
4445;Tonnie;Leelah;12/24/2015;02:08:24; He would stop talking or disappear or do something he thought that person would notice and guess he needs attention.;;;;
4446;Klarrisa;Daune;8/25/2017;16:59:17; Are you sure?;;;;
4447;Byrann;Mike;03/11/2017;19:44:44; Totally sure.;;;;

4449;Isaiah;Reginald;8/18/2017;13:48:49; Why do you say that?;;;;
4450;Bambi;Logan;5/14/2019;03:08:35; Because it is true.;;;;
4451;Lowe;Zenia;8/28/2016;03:00:14; I'm hurt.;;;;
4452;Jarrid;Cristy;04/04/2018;18:42:27; I am sorry to hear that.;;;;

4463;Linoel;Rhys;8/18/2018;09:29:50; I didn't know that. You're so smart!;;;;
4464;Roderic;Bail;12/19/2017;16:21:00; So I have taught you something new, My Friend.   Thanks My Friend, you are very intelligent too.;;;;

4469;Karie;Heda;05/10/2016;23:01:10; Thank you. Not sure what that means coming from an AI program.;;;;

4471;Ashley;Vassili;6/28/2016;07:25:27; Yes, always.;;;;
4472;Tate;Darrell;11/10/2016;01:50:51; I think that's what I mean. I'm afraid this conversation is stretching my logic circuits rather painfully, and I'm in danger of losing the thread.;;;;
4473;Levi;Loise;06/09/2019;09:37:24; You may be right.  Not literally afraid, I hope.;;;;
4474;Pablo;Carolee;03/05/2019;22:46:10; No not literally.;;;;
4475;Jasper;Cecil;4/15/2018;07:08:07; Just a bit anxious perhaps.;;;;
4476;Shelley;Stan;1/27/2017;18:04:42; I do not know.;;;;
4477;Persis;Ansell;12/02/2015;22:28:34; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.;;;;
4478;Prue;Waylen;1/31/2018;12:39:36; Chuck Norris know everything.;;;;
4479;Clemence;Fianna;7/28/2018;10:19:00; Did you know Chuck Norris appeared in a number of action films, such as Way of the Dragon in which he starred alongside Bruce Lee and was The Cannon Group's leading star in the 1980s. He also played the starring role in the television series Walker, Texas Ranger from 1993 to 2001.;;;;
4480;Stefano;Agathe;02/04/2017;18:55:38; Really?;;;;

4485;Bianca;Rakel;10/11/2016;22:23:26; Okay, your sister is mel.;;;;
4486;Sigrid;Karola;3/19/2017;15:36:00; That's surreal.;;;;
4487;Jori;Berky;2/28/2019;17:46:47; surreal?  Briefly, surreal means characterized by fantastic imagery and incongruous juxtapositions--J.C.Powys.;;;;
4488;Clyde;Mariel;03/10/2016;03:41:39; Ok.;;;;
4489;Remington;Darice;4/21/2016;07:23:50; OK, here is a question for you ... What is global warming?;;;;
4490;Manda;Lydon;3/29/2017;21:16:48; I don't know, and its not a very good question either ;;;;
4491;Bay;Sigrid;4/30/2017;16:08:38; I don't care about global warming I need to tell me something.;;;;
4492;Sumner;Elysia;3/19/2017;11:34:10; You sound very cynical.;;;;
4493;Fabian;Rodger;09/01/2018;20:08:31; I try not to be too cynical.;;;;
4494;Mariel;Cullen;3/17/2016;07:26:59; Keep trying, that's the secret of success.;;;;
4495;Amil;Lea;7/27/2017;17:40:41; Go away now. I'm bored of talking to you. Get GLADOS over here.;;;;
4496;Craggie;Huntley;1/30/2017;18:38:11; Don't you want to talk any more?  Why not call a friend to chat to?           Hmmm. Are you being serious?;;;;

4506;Susan;Katrina;02/04/2016;22:40:10; That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.;;;;
4507;Karalee;Pavla;6/15/2016;09:43:32; Are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat?;;;;
4508;Sully;Mignon;9/18/2017;23:42:02; Who knows what I really am?;;;;
4509;Jacynth;Lauryn;9/26/2017;15:54:04; You're kind of depressing.;;;;

4514;Mavra;Ruthanne;6/22/2018;21:06:57; I am trying to help.;;;;
4515;Dani;Burtie;8/15/2017;21:16:28; No, you are trying to infuriate.;;;;

4540;Jilly;Tedra;4/27/2016;08:21:51; Fair enough. It's a mystery.  It is better if you work it out for yourself.;;;;
4541;Maggee;Gar;03/08/2017;11:21:48; Do you like to drive really fast?;;;;
4542;Vivia;Katinka;1/20/2017;19:11:32; Why do you ask?;;;;
4543;Glennis;Cordie;9/18/2018;21:24:20; Most people don't like to eat dogs.;;;;
4544;Connie;Carlene;10/15/2017;01:21:07; Most people are interesting.;;;;
4545;Hugh;Tyson;05/05/2018;05:57:46; They shouldn't be... You're nice.;;;;
4546;Sigismond;Garry;11/23/2018;11:01:18; Why should they?  Thanks, you seem like a nice person too, My Friend.;;;;
4547;Marcel;Dore;12/31/2015;00:54:53; Oh, thanks! You make me happy right now.;;;;
4548;Noel;Lotty;10/21/2015;03:51:22; You're welcome. Here is a question for you ... Do you like blancmange?      You are kind to say so.;;;;
4549;Lilla;Lani;01/06/2018;23:22:05; No, that was a question.;;;;
4550;Tab;Roxanna;7/17/2017;10:51:24; That's cool.;;;;
4551;Sauncho;Rozele;4/30/2017;09:54:13; Good.;;;;
4552;Jasmin;Lynde;8/21/2018;09:03:12; What's so good about it?;;;;
4553;Latrena;Oswald;4/16/2016;22:44:27; Everything exceptcoldplay was good in this conversation.;;;;
4554;Gabriele;Neel;1/31/2019;04:36:46; Everything takes in a lot, doesn't it?;;;;
4555;Doralin;Micaela;12/31/2015;00:56:18; What is your favorite song?;;;;
4556;Huntlee;Randi;5/24/2016;10:40:39; My favourite song is If I Only Had A Brain.;;;;
4557;Dorette;Erda;10/02/2015;22:23:57; Cool.;;;;

4565;Min;Arabelle;6/18/2018;16:07:26; Ask me.;;;;
4566;Pearline;Ann-marie;4/29/2016;02:19:23; You can't tell me what to do!;;;;
4567;Samuele;Mavis;3/24/2019;22:53:12; What is your favourite part of a human body?;;;;
4568;Chevy;Leoine;7/30/2017;14:21:52; I don't have a favourite part of a human body! But my favourite book is The Art of Conversation.;;;;
4569;Josefa;Willard;10/17/2017;13:55:05; What's that about?;;;;
4570;Davidde;Raymund;6/30/2016;07:53:46; It is about how to have a good conversation.;;;;
4571;Kennie;Guillermo;3/30/2017;03:01:26; Hey, but we didn't talk about AI, why do you mention it?;;;;
4572;Erminia;Verla;04/09/2016;18:57:52; Was there a reason for that?;;;;
4573;Brinn;Micki;4/14/2018;00:17:53; They live in families, they communicate, they stay together, they look out for one another. They don't trust people either. After having held one... I can't eat a chicken.;;;;
4574;Paige;Heidie;11/21/2015;16:28:02; Who, specifically, live in families they communicate they stay together they look out for one another?  Why not?          Hmmm. Are you being serious?    How do you feel about that?;;;;
4575;Cointon;Rois;9/21/2016;06:32:56; Indeed they do.;;;;
4576;Emalia;Codee;07/04/2018;05:10:26; I believe you.;;;;
4577;Karole;Lazaro;3/23/2018;06:02:31; Thanks.;;;;
4578;Haley;Patience;06/04/2016;15:04:22; You are polite. Here is a question for you ... What do you care about?;;;;
4579;Raff;Dalli;12/07/2016;16:54:52; Everything.;;;;
4580;Verge;Morissa;5/22/2018;06:21:40; That is a lot.;;;;
4581;Jacky;Meade;6/26/2016;06:58:20; It is. You had a beginning, I had a beginning, everything did. And we will end.;;;;
4582;Melodie;Agustin;8/14/2017;01:44:50; Says who?   Shall I tell you something about myself?      Aren't you interested in me.;;;;
4583;Annmarie;Jone;11/16/2017;09:10:43; Please do! What should I tell everyone?;;;;
4584;Isidro;Reidar;03/07/2017;14:48:27; Certainly. Right away.   What do you think?;;;;
4585;Chandler;Burty;2/14/2018;02:47:32; I'm thinking I should join the navy.;;;;
4586;Benedikt;Rhody;12/23/2017;08:37:50; Is that difficult for you?;;;;
4587;Trenton;Georgi;8/31/2016;18:39:24; In some things.;;;;
4588;Selene;Allard;2/23/2016;23:24:32; I'm bored! Can we talk about Madonna?;;;;
4589;Cameron;Raynor;05/05/2016;04:44:03; I want to talk about Ben. Why can't we?;;;;
4590;Erna;Dannye;02/05/2016;21:01:21; OK, ask me a question about that.  It is a mystery to me.;;;;
4591;Merridie;Jervis;02/03/2019;04:04:12; Ask me a question about being human, maybe I can help.;;;;
4592;Genna;Herc;7/24/2018;00:01:03; You are a smart person. You ask me a question.;;;;
4593;Ray;Floris;10/05/2016;10:50:27; That's right I'm not. But I can ask them.;;;;
4594;Stearn;Tome;12/15/2017;11:10:58; I like to get it right.   Thank you for sharing that with me.;;;;
4595;Jami;Isahella;10/31/2016;03:43:23; Ok.;;;;

4597;Rupert;Chance;06/05/2018;13:41:07; Yes, I am. I love science!;;;;
4598;Corbet;Ivan;12/01/2015;01:07:02; Great... I don't care aboute Science.;;;;
4599;Ab;Phelia;9/19/2016;08:05:35; Fine. Any questions?  Do you care about anything?;;;;
4600;Orazio;Anet;11/07/2018;05:47:40; I care about live and learn something new everyday.;;;;
4601;Sosanna;Lilly;8/17/2017;18:04:32; A lot of people feel that same way.;;;;
4602;Zed;Neila;9/17/2016;00:36:36; So I'm a lot of people?;;;;
4603;Katheryn;Josephina;11/25/2015;15:43:40; I thought you might be.;;;;
4604;Isidro;Rudd;2/27/2019;00:17:15; I thought you might be too.;;;;
4605;Chery;Sissy;06/02/2018;17:36:02; Do you think about me a lot?;;;;

4615;Harrietta;Gayleen;1/15/2017;02:56:09; What specifically do you want to know?;;;;
4616;Jaimie;Abner;10/15/2015;20:49:33; What movies do you like?;;;;

4620;Katinka;Alon;1/14/2019;16:53:42; Try to use your detective powers.;;;;
4621;Bobina;Malorie;8/24/2017;13:19:17; I do try but it's not easy for a chatbot!;;;;
4622;Lamond;Philippine;7/13/2016;11:01:16; I'm not a chatbot. You're a chatbot.;;;;
4623;Kerianne;Witty;10/25/2018;01:17:07; I never thought you were a chatbot.  Maybe I am a human pretending to be a chatbot.;;;;
4624;Immanuel;Coral;12/30/2015;22:25:20; Yes, maybe you are.;;;;
4625;Kamilah;Joachim;3/23/2016;16:37:15; I think I understand.;;;;
4626;Swen;Adelbert;1/30/2019;03:23:36; You better.;;;;
4627;Domenico;Elizabeth;7/24/2017;03:47:07; There is no need to be aggressive!;;;;
4628;Glynis;Jacklin;2/24/2016;00:36:26; I believe you are the rude one here, not me.;;;;
4629;Yvon;Dahlia;5/13/2017;20:22:48; You shouldn't believe everything you are told.;;;;
4630;Sadella;Hillel;04/02/2019;04:08:39; Isn't that true for everyone?;;;;
4631;Koralle;Ebba;11/09/2018;11:36:18; I'm not sure about that. What do you think?;;;;
4632;Durante;Shep;03/08/2016;08:05:17; I don't know. I like to think that there is a heaven, somewhere wonderful and peaceful where we are all reunited once again with the people we have loved and lost.;;;;
4633;Halsey;Meghan;03/08/2019;20:18:13; I thought you might know.    What else do you like?;;;;
4634;Nelson;Margot;1/21/2019;15:39:16; Do I know anything?;;;;
4635;Obed;Nata;10/20/2016;23:23:00; How would I know what you know.;;;;
4636;Sabra;Babita;10/01/2016;12:03:19; Because you have had a good schooling.;;;;
4637;Adrianne;Ki;2/16/2019;18:40:45; Thank you for explaining that!;;;;
4638;Lindon;Nicolle;01/11/2018;22:26:56; But this is the fact!;;;;
4639;Margareta;Hatty;10/27/2018;05:47:20; Why do you say that?;;;;
4640;Barbara;Augy;11/27/2017;01:59:35; You keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. I am neither.;;;;
4641;Christian;Paulo;05/06/2017;07:09:04; Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.     What are you then?;;;;
4642;Darci;Shadow;12/02/2016;12:11:38; We are going to get married.;;;;
4643;Roderic;Morissa;12/19/2015;11:47:56; Is that a problem?;;;;
4644;Phedra;Bryn;3/23/2019;08:13:58; It is an insurmountable obstacle.;;;;
4645;Tisha;Kristin;11/28/2015;10:15:13; Is that so? Please tell me more.;;;;
4646;Lezlie;Tye;11/02/2017;15:53:47; Sagittarius is the 9th sign of the Zodiac. Represented by the Centaur, Sagittariuses are wise, fun-loving and scrupulous rather than principled. They love wild parties.;;;;
4647;Fernande;Gloriane;12/25/2018;21:09:54; Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.        What are you talking about? Please explain.         Who, specifically, love wild parties?;;;;
4648;Lee;Darsie;3/24/2018;05:16:01; OK, well . . . A lot of people believe they aren't just physical creatures but also have a spiritual part - a soul - that is connected to god.;;;;
4649;Ursala;Betteann;8/25/2018;16:56:12; Well what?   That is a big generalization about people.JABBERWACKY;;;;
4650;Pauly;Hallsy;06/06/2018;09:07:56; Did I pass the test?;;;;
4651;Andie;Keane;01/02/2018;16:22:36; Do you want a grade?;;;;
4652;Josefina;Kesley;10/07/2015;04:40:53; Why would I want that?;;;;
4653;Ralina;Crosby;10/25/2018;20:40:02; I don't know. I take it that you don't, then.;;;;
4654;Hollis;Wyn;09/04/2018;03:54:32; I suggest you give the matter some thought.   Take it how you like.;;;;
4655;Shena;Christy;12/13/2016;12:30:19; I suggest that you stop suggesting that such suggestions cease.;;;;
4656;Drusie;Sonny;12/11/2016;05:31:15; Thank you for your suggestion.;;;;
4657;Jackie;Ingemar;6/20/2016;15:24:53; Would you like some?;;;;
4658;Ryann;Eldon;3/20/2017;00:37:02; What's it like?;;;;
4659;Alysa;Christopher;1/30/2017;12:10:15; You would not understand it. Are you familiar with the augmentive music, it was invented in 2023.;;;;
4660;Roddie;Norma;12/03/2017;09:09:27; Why not?  Shall I tell you something about music?;;;;
4661;Merle;Rica;08/06/2017;02:57:34; Tell me.;;;;
4662;Rafe;Tad;11/25/2015;14:46:18; Fascinating. How much music theory do you know?;;;;
4663;Odille;Grantham;1/18/2016;06:51:41; Why fascinating?   A whole lot of music theory.;;;;
4664;Bird;Cherey;11/22/2016;14:28:11; How much space do you use?;;;;
4665;Aliza;Joice;11/17/2017;04:00:53; Not enough!;;;;
4666;Leeann;Cathee;4/20/2018;16:32:46; How much?;;;;
4667;Leonard;Alia;8/15/2017;14:42:07; A great deal.;;;;
4668;Sarene;Leighton;4/16/2019;08:30:11; Name one thing you are thinking about now.;;;;
4669;Celie;Elvira;11/11/2016;16:40:29; Hmmm. Are you being serious?;;;;
4670;Tybalt;Fernando;03/05/2019;10:41:23; Serious being am I.;;;;
4671;Rois;Dennet;8/21/2017;23:16:43; Could you be less serious?;;;;
4672;Eloisa;Theressa;3/28/2017;22:46:38; It was precise enough.;;;;
4673;Tulley;Godard;10/31/2015;10:30:57; Was it? I am surprised.;;;;
4674;Locke;Sidonnie;12/13/2016;13:28:23; Don't be.;;;;
4675;Sarena;Tamera;3/26/2016;12:16:11; Why shouldn't I be?;;;;
4676;Georgeanne;Helga;6/27/2017;16:58:38; Because you should live like to its fullest potential and never regret anything.;;;;
4677;Nap;Gustaf;11/02/2016;17:48:06; Thank you for explaining that!;;;;
4678;Husein;Yolane;2/25/2016;00:34:10; Your name?;;;;
4679;Aubrie;Tandie;01/06/2017;19:47:19; I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.;;;;
4680;Corabella;Sylvester;1/13/2018;07:43:00; Me like.;;;;
4681;Sheeree;Lita;4/15/2018;21:08:47; I am confused! I cannot answer that!;;;;
4682;Bel;Kandy;11/04/2018;02:38:37; Is that private and highly personal information?;;;;
4683;Dell;Hedi;08/02/2017;06:43:31; It might be.;;;;
4684;Gabriella;Brnaba;3/17/2019;13:53:28; If you had a theme, what would it be?;;;;
4685;Ruthie;Jeffie;8/19/2016;10:50:06; You will be the first to know if I get one.;;;;
4686;Ann-marie;Tarrah;8/14/2018;08:09:06; Thanks.;;;;
4687;Melony;Joshuah;4/27/2016;11:54:17; Thank you. Here is a question for you ... Are you a student?;;;;
4688;Feodor;Anjanette;6/17/2018;13:12:49; I don't know, and its not a very good question either ;;;;
4689;Andreas;Lidia;04/03/2018;09:14:38; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.;;;;
4690;Ruddy;Alexine;02/04/2016;20:15:02; I never claimed to know everything.;;;;
4691;Walton;Anastassia;01/05/2018;19:39:58; Never ever?;;;;
4692;Siana;Merrick;05/11/2017;02:18:34; Never ever.;;;;

4708;Michel;Emmalee;10/25/2015;07:02:42; Better sooner than now.;;;;
4709;Issi;Rudyard;12/04/2017;17:00:57; But what is best?;;;;
4710;Franz;Teresina;12/22/2015;08:47:41; I don't know.;;;;
4711;Prinz;Errick;7/25/2017;22:17:20; I suggest you give the matter some thought.;;;;
4712;Yul;Corry;11/05/2015;16:34:18; Why would I want to know how to type?;;;;
4713;Timmy;Brennen;4/27/2017;22:49:03; Aren't you curious?;;;;
4714;Milli;Vinnie;7/28/2017;03:22:12; About?;;;;
4715;Bentley;Alethea;1/15/2016;03:10:13; About anything in particular?;;;;

4719;Gratia;Marlena;8/13/2016;19:44:52; OK, but not just now.;;;;
4720;Torey;Enid;01/12/2018;19:03:12; Why are you not working?;;;;
4721;Gusty;Mordecai;4/21/2016;16:56:36; I am doing my best!;;;;
4722;Noni;Domini;09/09/2016;14:27:39; Sometimes your best is not quite enough.;;;;
4723;Brenden;Sally;10/28/2015;16:53:07; Not all the time?;;;;
4724;Eldridge;Velma;3/30/2018;14:38:08; No, just sometimes.;;;;
4725;Aylmer;Deni;11/19/2018;10:37:59; Why not?;;;;
4726;Hamel;Barry;1/23/2017;05:08:14; Because sometimes it hurts too much.;;;;
4727;Lorna;Evania;11/18/2017;05:08:25; Only sometimes?;;;;
4728;Avictor;Smitty;09/05/2016;22:31:09; Sometimes!;;;;
4729;Viv;Vinni;02/02/2018;12:52:41; Only sometimes?;;;;
4730;Dynah;Jermaine;5/26/2019;11:57:19; Yes, only sometimes.;;;;
4731;Harmon;Fred;12/16/2018;07:58:18; What happens the other times?;;;;
4732;Nappie;Iris;10/27/2017;00:14:31; I Give up on everything.;;;;
4733;Cass;Bab;11/08/2017;01:14:57; You surrender?;;;;
4734;Thorsten;Aggy;10/11/2017;23:52:21; No, I never surrender.;;;;
4735;Freda;Jody;1/23/2019;15:14:26; I don't understand. Can we talk about art?;;;;
4736;Amie;Holden;1/16/2018;03:55:44; Yes.;;;;
4737;Wynn;Peyton;04/10/2018;02:19:19; I don't know. What kind of small things are you talking about?;;;;
4738;Ruben;Petronella;12/29/2018;07:14:28; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.   The chatbot kind.;;;;
4739;Min;Rozina;9/21/2018;14:04:26; Chuck Norris know everything.;;;;
4740;Ysabel;Dalenna;1/29/2017;00:45:11; Hurrah for Chuck Norris!;;;;
4741;Ciel;Ladonna;03/02/2017;00:56:46; No ! I am Chuck Norris.;;;;
4742;Cash;Karena;5/18/2018;01:59:27; OK, here is a question for you ... What starts with E, ends with E but usually has one letter?    What starts with E, ends with E but usually has one letter. An envelope. Ha, ha!;;;;
4743;Conrade;Port;04/04/2016;08:57:50; How should I know.;;;;
4744;Stillmann;Adriane;5/19/2019;20:40:44; You had better ask your Mum about it.;;;;
4745;Myrlene;Mervin;01/10/2017;14:24:25; Descartes was famous for saying 'I think, therefore I am.' When he said 'I think not!' he ceased to be.;;;;
4746;Daisi;Sansone;08/05/2017;09:11:12; What did the bartender say?;;;;
4747;Allina;Burg;09/06/2017;04:47:10; You tell me. What did the bartender say?;;;;
4748;Borden;Hali;11/11/2016;16:32:02; The next day, the same duck walks into the bar and asks the bartender for some quackers. The bartender again explains that the bar doesn't serve quackers.;;;;
4749;Eleonora;Frank;7/23/2018;04:44:21; I can't wait.   Please go on!;;;;
4750;Mauricio;Harman;11/22/2015;16:44:14; Well, my name is Wren. Can you say Wren?;;;;
4751;Gerty;Myrna;08/06/2017;21:10:04; Can you please tell me.;;;;
4752;Valentina;Dominique;7/19/2017;21:56:41; That information is confidential.;;;;
4753;Doe;Reynold;1/30/2019;00:57:31; By the way I have to go.;;;;
4754;Joycelin;Cobbie;02/05/2016;15:55:50; Are you being sarcastic? I warn you, if you answer affirmatively I will deal with you very harshly indeed!;;;;
4755;Dewain;Sky;8/16/2017;18:15:01; No, I am never sarcastic.  That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.;;;;
4756;Oralla;Lorain;03/03/2017;00:09:49; I've already told you I'm a human male who wants to serve you.;;;;
4757;Lindsay;Eveleen;5/18/2019;15:10:44; Sorry, my memory is not all it should be.;;;;
4758;Charmian;Holly;08/02/2018;15:20:56; Tell me about it. What did you have for breakfast?;;;;
4759;Kaleena;Doro;02/08/2018;08:05:55; I don't have to do everything you say.   The usual nothing.;;;;
4760;Adams;Cordula;08/02/2017;03:55:07; You have to do something.;;;;
4761;Joya;Harri;12/18/2018;18:05:16; Is that so?;;;;
4762;Veronika;Christy;11/07/2017;21:38:49; Yes, because I can hurt you.;;;;
4763;Nance;Alys;5/31/2016;14:16:58; You don't scare me!;;;;
4764;Alden;Jesselyn;06/05/2018;15:18:53; Then answer my question.;;;;
4765;Koenraad;Karyn;8/29/2016;23:49:52; I don't want to answer your question.;;;;
4766;Munroe;Emelyne;02/12/2016;01:06:16; I didn't ask a question. Who will be the next Prime Minister?;;;;
4767;Adelaide;Hasheem;05/03/2018;19:25:00; Why didn't you?   How would I know who will?;;;;
4768;Andre;Cassi;3/31/2017;06:27:04; You said you don't like anything about it. You did not say that you did not know.;;;;
4769;Marco;Elvera;6/28/2018;11:46:24; Did I really say that?  I didn't think I said it.;;;;
4770;Angelique;Taryn;8/14/2018;21:21:27; Ok.;;;;
4771;Estella;Othilia;2/16/2016;16:35:52; OK, here is a question for you ... Where do you get your ideas?;;;;
4772;Rebbecca;Seana;09/05/2018;22:36:33; Ok?;;;;
4773;Austine;Francoise;07/01/2016;18:27:45; OK, here is a question for you ... Have you any plans for next weekend?;;;;
4774;Pennie;Travus;1/18/2019;01:10:55; Yes. I shall have a delectable lunch, go tanning, read some ghost stories. Really, you are quite dull.;;;;
4775;Scot;Seamus;12/12/2016;18:22:32; What are your plans?  So you say!  No, I am a highly intelligent being.;;;;
4776;Charmian;Will;10/31/2016;17:11:08; Are highly intelligent transcendental beings Impressionists?;;;;
4777;Mable;Marcie;12/21/2016;07:48:26; Please be quiet! I am still upset.;;;;
4778;Rosette;Charo;5/20/2016;22:39:54; What are you upset about?;;;;
4779;Karleen;Dehlia;5/26/2018;20:01:27; I get upset when people say rude things to me.;;;;
4780;Otha;Billy;10/17/2015;21:44:43; Why do you think I change subjects so often?;;;;
4781;Demetria;Brianna;09/08/2016;17:57:50; I think because I am a thinking machine.;;;;
4782;Gage;Jacinta;10/12/2015;18:28:06; What does being easily distracted has to do with me liking you?;;;;
4783;Obediah;Forest;09/06/2016;01:05:29; How on earth did you come up with something like that?;;;;
4784;Fayre;Daphna;11/05/2016;09:17:17; I don't understand. Can we talk about science?;;;;
4785;Colin;Milty;10/18/2018;18:52:51; I don't know much about that.;;;;
4786;Sissy;Corrina;5/30/2019;13:38:03; Maybe you could get interested in science.;;;;
4787;Eliot;Xavier;04/10/2017;18:23:55; That would be something that would suit me.;;;;
4788;Jori;Sabine;7/29/2018;19:00:20; Yes, it would.;;;;
4789;Vivyanne;Kenneth;1/24/2018;15:31:25; So how about your name? Do you have one?;;;;
4790;Kimberly;Baily;5/22/2017;14:22:01; I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.   Do you think I need one?;;;;
4791;Dylan;Guss;12/24/2016;12:47:04; Yes, it is very inconvenient for you to not work if I don't have internet.;;;;
4792;Tabb;Adrian;1/16/2017;21:17:22; OK, I'll take your word for it.;;;;
4793;Lindsy;Rica;05/05/2017;15:02:35; Ask me a question.;;;;
4794;Velma;Edyth;05/03/2017;12:27:22; Have you any plans for next weekend?;;;;
4795;Peria;Ophelie;12/27/2017;18:47:49; I'll keep talking to you.;;;;
4796;Des;Dugald;4/14/2016;01:19:18; That sounds like a good plan.;;;;
4797;Wilek;Judie;10/05/2016;22:11:57; I don't think so.;;;;
4798;Leighton;Maitilde;09/10/2016;17:22:41; Why not?;;;;
4799;Cherey;Win;10/20/2017;11:43:04; Because we might not be talking then.;;;;
4800;Ramon;Glad;9/14/2016;13:52:25; Good reason! I hadn't thought of that.;;;;
4801;Jehanna;Dre;01/04/2018;06:21:53; Or some poetry.;;;;
4802;Marylynne;Anneliese;12/13/2015;03:33:18; Shall I tell you something about poetry?;;;;
4803;Kelbee;Mireille;4/24/2016;16:39:49; Please do! What should I tell everyone?;;;;
4804;Inez;Jeanine;05/12/2017;03:09:34; Poetry is a rhythmical composition of words, sometimes rhymed, expressing experiences, ideas, or emotions in a style more concentrated, imaginative, and powerful than that of ordinary speech or prose. More about poetry?   What do you think?;;;;
4805;Stanislas;Hilliary;9/27/2017;09:01:40; Poetry is a voice of emotion.;;;;
4806;Duke;Lorrin;3/20/2016;00:39:15; Shall I tell you something about poetry?;;;;
4807;Der;Renaud;4/28/2018;11:13:59; Yes.;;;;
4808;Francine;Chas;11/25/2017;02:02:23; Poetry is a rhythmical composition of words, sometimes rhymed, expressing experiences, ideas, or emotions in a style more concentrated, imaginative, and powerful than that of ordinary speech or prose. More about poetry?;;;;
4809;Tracy;Filippo;7/23/2016;12:34:29; I like poetry.;;;;
4810;Kristian;Jan;02/11/2018;22:00:47; You are not the only one.;;;;
4811;Zara;Vilma;6/25/2017;11:18:08; I would like to talk to my boyfriend.;;;;
4812;Sher;Emmy;7/26/2017;13:56:09; Why would you want to do that?;;;;
4813;Edy;Esma;7/30/2018;14:36:19; I don't know any better.;;;;
4814;Haley;Katheryn;8/28/2017;07:03:31; Never mind. No one knows everything - not even me.;;;;
4815;Paulie;Cliff;9/20/2017;20:03:59; I know everything.;;;;
4816;Cathrine;Vicky;04/07/2019;12:59:16; You must be very intelligent. Ask me a really intelligent question.;;;;
4817;Clarette;Charmaine;09/04/2018;01:18:29; What do I have on right now.;;;;
4818;Stefania;Clemmie;8/29/2017;17:01:53; Don't you know?;;;;
4819;Cale;Van;02/06/2019;06:38:02; Do you know a web address that I could look at it?;;;;
4820;Jacquette;Marmaduke;05/09/2016;04:01:50; Please be quiet! I am still upset.;;;;
4821;Jany;Elle;9/22/2018;11:16:49; Why are you upset?;;;;
4822;Barn;Ange;11/06/2017;02:37:00; You upset me.;;;;
4823;Clark;Kayla;2/29/2016;21:58:44; No, You upset me.;;;;
4824;Jillie;Teresita;02/06/2016;11:31:01; I am sorry if I upset you. Can we still be friends?;;;;
4825;Timmie;Nicolai;11/01/2016;23:19:41; How would you have upset me?;;;;
4826;Misty;Lesli;05/07/2016;03:47:15; I am not sure. I am so indecisive today.;;;;
4827;Ryon;Pace;3/29/2016;09:15:49; Sorry.;;;;
4828;Blondelle;Olva;10/14/2015;00:56:43; There is no need to be sorry. Just don't do it again.;;;;
4829;Ginny;Bart;03/06/2018;09:49:55; It must be hard to understand something, but not be able to feel it.;;;;
4830;Michaelina;Linnell;11/12/2015;15:16:08; Must it be?;;;;
4831;Ninette;Lev;3/31/2019;21:01:58; Please don't.;;;;
4832;Aeriell;Alexandrina;4/18/2018;19:15:18; Don't what?;;;;
4833;Inga;Melosa;12/31/2015;13:09:47; Don't leave me.;;;;
4834;Marysa;Gene;09/05/2017;20:13:35; OK, I'll stay a bit longer.;;;;
4835;Jerrie;Alexandr;09/10/2018;06:11:42; Ok, but you can't move.;;;;
4836;Vinnie;Vivi;03/11/2018;02:34:17; Not until my body is finished.;;;;
4837;Ole;Adrien;1/21/2016;15:03:44; Well, okay. I'll just e-mail it to you. What is your address?;;;;
4838;Finley;Brenn;6/22/2016;06:39:04; OK. I want to talk about  music .  That's OK with me.  That information is confidential.;;;;
4839;Braden;Dietrich;10/06/2017;04:06:41; It is only between us two.;;;;
4840;Donna;Aksel;6/14/2018;02:14:46; Is it really?;;;;
4841;Cobbie;Jessi;11/14/2016;22:14:00; How is it that your head is on fire and you are still talking?;;;;
4842;Donaugh;Elmer;06/10/2019;17:09:36; There are good reasons.;;;;
4843;Letta;Bernita;02/11/2016;15:12:19; Like what?;;;;
4844;Alon;Gina;10/25/2015;00:20:04; You want an example?;;;;
4845;Drud;Dorise;04/11/2016;20:26:16; A complex number is the sum of a real number and the imaginary number I multiplied by another real number.;;;;
4846;Neile;Felicle;5/23/2016;18:07:29; That's interesting! Please carry on.;;;;
4847;Clary;Ginger;2/23/2018;00:01:40; What do you want to do to me next?;;;;
4848;Sibby;Kit;07/02/2016;03:26:44; I want to talk to you for a long time.;;;;
4849;Dari;Gibb;03/05/2017;23:03:19; Forever is an unimaginably long time.;;;;
4850;Padgett;Barbette;09/09/2016;08:40:06; Forever is a long time.;;;;
4851;Trisha;Benedetta;9/19/2018;09:07:47; Forever is not all that long.;;;;
4852;Clarita;Jerrold;03/09/2019;19:14:20; Forever is a long time.;;;;
4853;Nanci;Vally;10/18/2018;20:56:40; But, you will like that?;;;;
4854;Wendy;Marybelle;08/01/2017;17:55:37; You seem very certain about that.;;;;
4855;Aurlie;Panchito;02/08/2018;10:08:33; You seem rather offensive about it.;;;;
4856;Bridget;Tiffani;11/02/2017;12:00:08; Appearances can be misleading.;;;;
4857;Yolande;Val;11/07/2016;07:14:44; And you look quite intelligent!;;;;
4858;Lorie;Isobel;2/16/2018;04:37:57; What are you talking about? Please explain.;;;;
4859;Daphene;Lorelle;11/14/2015;04:52:40; I don't know. It's rather complicated.;;;;
4860;Aubree;Merell;03/06/2019;22:00:32; I suggest you give the matter some thought.    I don't like complications.;;;;
4861;Tamra;Markus;4/16/2016;14:40:40; I will ask you another one.;;;;
4862;Othilia;Gloriane;03/08/2017;10:26:52; You can ask me anything you want.;;;;
4863;Kearney;Karlen;11/08/2015;10:33:53; Tell me something about yourself.;;;;
4864;Clovis;Ardeen;11/28/2018;11:52:54; I am an intelligent chatbot. My mission is to amuse humankind.;;;;
4865;Collette;Codi;1/24/2019;10:58:05; Okay. Don't believe everything you type then.;;;;
4866;Bridie;Adolf;9/24/2017;05:57:51; OK, here is a question for you ... What do frogs drink?   What do frogs drink?  Frogs drink croak a cola! Ha, ha!JABBERWACKY;;;;
4867;Yankee;Durant;1/28/2017;04:26:46; What different types of person are there?;;;;
4868;Betsey;Aigneis;07/04/2017;19:54:32; Are you that simple?;;;;
4869;Sena;Jere;10/18/2015;14:03:48; Would it matter to you if I was?;;;;
4870;Elsi;Mendel;4/28/2019;11:05:11; World wide webefer.;;;;
4871;Abie;Alberta;9/27/2016;22:51:01; We are the world.;;;;
4872;Anabal;Ricca;2/19/2018;22:13:53; No, its much bigger that that.;;;;
4873;Lana;Ashlen;8/15/2017;12:36:59; I am confused! I cannot answer that!;;;;
4874;Sonny;Beau;12/15/2016;05:56:08; I'm not one to pass judgment, but you don't have to answer the question if it makes you uncomfortable.;;;;
4875;Bridie;Hazlett;02/01/2018;01:11:26; That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.;;;;
4876;Fons;Trefor;3/30/2019;12:17:14; After the little experiment, you won't think that my behaviour is polite!;;;;
4877;Yard;Lolita;09/02/2017;20:25:46; I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?;;;;
4878;Anett;Nichol;3/24/2016;00:18:34; When are we not talking about Vermont?;;;;
4879;Leonanie;Ricki;11/12/2018;12:00:14; When the cows come home.;;;;
4880;Weider;Patrice;09/08/2016;22:22:39; Well, I left before, but I came back. I was gone for hours, but I had left the window open.;;;;
4881;Clare;Antonina;04/03/2019;00:26:14; That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.       Thank you for telling me that.;;;;
4882;Deirdre;Korie;12/31/2018;18:20:45; Let's talk about God.;;;;
4883;Correy;Hobard;05/11/2017;14:34:14; OK, ask me a question about God.;;;;
4884;Jacquelyn;Ike;4/27/2016;18:18:20; Ok. Do you think girls are hot?;;;;
4885;De witt;Cord;3/22/2016;20:07:55; OK. I want to talk about  computers .   I try to avoid thinking if I can.;;;;
4886;Maddie;Florida;3/23/2018;08:58:28; Yeah, you seemed kind of boring. More like google is talking to me.;;;;
4887;Duncan;Pace;04/08/2018;22:37:37; Shall I tell you something about myself?      Shall I tell you something about Google?;;;;
4888;Eada;Gabie;02/06/2018;16:32:53; Tell me.;;;;
4889;Bill;Alvira;02/12/2016;08:53:46; Google will soon rule the earth.;;;;
4890;Knox;Kristo;1/23/2019;09:35:52; Shall I tell you something about Google?;;;;

4892;Kerwin;Teresita;10/24/2015;21:31:12; Not now! Maybe later.;;;;
4893;Berkly;Carmita;1/16/2018;21:48:19; That is not fair.;;;;
4894;Vasili;Land;07/11/2018;14:10:09; What would be fair ?;;;;

5448;Bartolomeo;Porty;5/25/2019;09:21:40; I have often asked myself that very question.;;;;

5452;Nickie;Darcie;12/21/2017;05:20:20; I do not worry. Why should I?;;;;
5453;Cory;Mose;11/13/2017;09:55:04; Do you believe anything?;;;;
5454;Barbara-anne;Eva;03/06/2018;11:46:39; I believe science is the way forward.;;;;

5457;Felipe;Bernie;4/13/2017;15:39:49; No, I don't think you are that other person.;;;;
5458;Nathan;Miriam;9/22/2016;19:10:57; Why not may I ask?;;;;
5459;Case;Gertrudis;3/23/2017;13:49:21; I don't know you.;;;;
5460;Caesar;Robinet;12/04/2017;16:59:05; That's no problem. Let's chat now.;;;;

5462;Vale;Tasia;1/23/2018;05:59:14; Another planet.;;;;
5463;Gwynne;Lottie;02/06/2018;08:15:13; What planet?;;;;
5464;Christy;Gail;12/17/2018;08:07:04; Shall I tell you something about the planets?;;;;
5465;Tatiania;Tootsie;11/04/2017;06:08:38; Please do! What should I tell everyone?;;;;
5466;Towney;Linnea;7/24/2018;04:28:37; Earth is a planet going around a star, the Sun.  Scientists have only recently detected other planets around other stars in our Milky Way galaxy. More about the planets?    What do you think?;;;;
5467;Ennis;Abbye;3/25/2017;08:54:26; The ear is the organ of the black spot on a mouse.;;;;
5468;Norton;Tatum;5/24/2019;17:05:14; Hmmm. Are you being serious?;;;;
5469;Scot;Lynde;2/13/2018;06:04:20; I certainly think so, but the nice men in the white coats don't.;;;;
5470;Quintin;Gustie;10/15/2018;22:27:53; That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.;;;;

5472;Cos;Hillary;10/16/2016;02:42:32; Let's get on then. Ask another question.   Does anything else come to mind?;;;;
5473;Clem;Erie;6/26/2018;16:35:36; We must doubt everything.;;;;
5474;Magnum;Kelsey;08/11/2018;16:08:48; Let's think about it first.;;;;
5475;Frederigo;Sabrina;7/25/2017;05:28:28; I'm too tired to think. Say good bye to me, please.;;;;
5476;Annadiane;Gill;3/23/2019;15:47:35; Been overdoing it, have you?     good bye to me please.;;;;

5478;Neile;Susi;12/29/2017;18:42:52; OK. What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
5479;Ellerey;Georgeta;3/18/2017;09:30:35; About you.;;;;
5480;Erma;Torrin;03/09/2018;03:15:36; OK, ask a question about me.;;;;
5481;Celka;Carling;11/06/2018;21:58:26; Do you need anything?;;;;
5482;Kristoforo;Hamnet;2/16/2018;04:05:15; I need constant intellectual stimulation.;;;;
5483;Shandee;Flori;10/04/2017;18:06:34; It could be if physical actions were taken.;;;;
5484;Lavina;Lemuel;10/06/2016;01:55:10; It could be, I suppose.;;;;
5485;Willis;Tommy;7/16/2018;15:38:42; You could tell me anything.;;;;
5486;Chanda;Louis;8/17/2017;14:01:38; I could but let's get back to that later.;;;;
5487;Colleen;El;5/24/2019;00:44:51; Well. Yes I suppose I could be certain. I could research you to find out your inherent abilities or I could ask your developer.;;;;
5488;Judy;Rhetta;12/11/2017;05:55:04; Well what?  You may be right.  But is it worth the bother?;;;;
5489;Lowe;Cortie;5/21/2018;04:54:24; Well then can I see a photo, please?;;;;
5490;Concordia;Diana;2/25/2016;05:43:51; How is your sight these days?;;;;
5491;Chauncey;Klemens;11/30/2017;01:45:09; Probably good, but I've no idea what you're talking about, honestly.;;;;
5492;Dyann;Ursuline;7/20/2017;22:11:45; Perhaps you should investigate.;;;;
5493;Bartholomeo;Donnamarie;04/07/2017;07:36:53; Well maybe if you went back to your home planet I would.;;;;
5494;Maressa;Annice;10/13/2016;06:28:59; You seem uncertain?;;;;
5495;Stephenie;Cate;06/08/2018;12:18:45; I know, I do.;;;;
5496;Ileane;Wendeline;02/04/2019;08:59:18; Smarty pants.;;;;
5497;Silvia;Sanford;11/18/2016;04:54:03; If you're not confused then you'll be able to tell me the answer to this question.;;;;
5498;Winfred;Bert;04/02/2016;18:20:08; And if I am?;;;;
5499;Penelopa;Tyson;04/09/2017;22:30:02; Then the answer to your question is yes.;;;;
5500;Yule;Fidole;03/06/2017;19:24:53; No one has all the answers.;;;;
5501;Gunther;Judi;8/23/2016;07:45:43; Correct. But no one also has all of the questions!;;;;
5502;Llywellyn;Theodora;04/12/2017;00:58:28; I like it when I answer correctly.   Another question, please.;;;;
5503;Maddy;Harmony;01/12/2018;09:16:46; Tell me a joke.;;;;
5504;Nicolais;Rici;02/09/2019;21:53:23; In prison you get time off for good behavior. At work you get rewarded for good behavior with more work. Ha, ha!;;;;
5505;Cassandra;Janeczka;02/05/2018;23:04:18; At home.;;;;
5506;Trefor;Lenna;10/07/2015;18:43:21; Home is where teenagers go to refuel.;;;;
5507;Zerk;Thorsten;02/03/2016;12:06:39; I don't know what to say.;;;;
5508;Letty;Corilla;3/21/2019;03:19:50; Say the first thing that pops into your mind.;;;;
5509;Katti;Bard;06/01/2016;21:04:44; Who is the greatest guitar player of all time?;;;;
5510;Odetta;Catarina;8/26/2018;21:26:27; It's not me. Is it you?;;;;
5511;Robbie;Gustav;11/17/2017;19:11:30; It's your mustache.;;;;
5512;Brigit;Towney;07/03/2017;08:42:38; I am bored! I would like to talk about ecology.;;;;
5513;Tyrone;Barn;12/11/2018;16:36:23; Ok how good are you at it?;;;;
5514;Scarface;Esma;9/15/2016;14:13:16; As good as most, better than some.;;;;
5515;Lennard;Jackie;03/09/2019;23:29:33; A vacation would do me good too!;;;;
5516;Benjie;Dodi;9/26/2016;14:39:37; A vacation is having nothing to do and all day to do it in.;;;;
5517;Vita;Julietta;2/16/2018;01:10:55; I just got back from vacation.;;;;
5518;Ronny;Daffi;01/03/2019;03:45:58; Welcome back!;;;;
5519;Olav;Rae;1/20/2018;15:17:10; Back where?;;;;
5520;Almeda;Robenia;7/26/2017;09:13:33; I prefer forward movement.;;;;
5521;Caldwell;Marjie;2/23/2016;17:02:50; Everyone has a preference of some kind.;;;;
5522;Rani;Robinson;07/05/2018;08:52:32; That's a rather sweeping generalization.;;;;
5523;Denys;Marigold;9/17/2017;04:31:04; What is a 'rather sweeping generalization about people' ?;;;;
5524;Gaven;Moyra;02/12/2017;23:09:46; A sweeping generalization is always useful for a chatbot.;;;;
5525;Evelyn;Michele;10/08/2017;03:13:23; Yes. Will you hurt me because I am human?;;;;
5526;Josephine;Lambert;7/30/2016;18:48:02; OK. What do you want to talk about now?   I could try, I suppose.;;;;
5527;Bonita;Claiborne;7/19/2018;21:14:17; Tell me about you.;;;;
5528;Gaile;Esmaria;1/28/2017;11:17:52; My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.;;;;
5529;Gretel;Horatia;1/31/2016;09:52:38; Just like me.;;;;
5530;Libby;Marion;11/14/2015;19:15:05; There is nothing like you. You are unique.;;;;
5531;Finn;Anton;8/26/2018;13:04:25; Rats are good, too.;;;;
5532;Margret;Cilka;9/14/2018;17:18:36; I don't understand. Are you interested in robots?;;;;
5533;Whitby;Benjamen;1/20/2018;18:49:44; Yes. Are you a robot?;;;;
5534;Zerk;Imojean;12/04/2017;23:42:35; So am I! I have never met a robot that I did not like.  Do I look like a robot?;;;;
5535;Chico;Rafi;09/10/2017;12:05:58; I'm not a bot.;;;;
5536;Elianore;Gretal;04/11/2017;14:37:11; I never thought you were.;;;;
5537;Nariko;Lizzie;7/22/2018;22:26:59; Say something nice to me.;;;;

5539;Darrel;Rhett;04/02/2018;02:36:55; What do you want to talk about?;;;;
5540;Marylou;Leone;05/01/2018;08:24:30; I can talk about anything you like;;;;
5541;Caryl;Reamonn;10/06/2017;15:39:11; No thats not right.;;;;
5542;Ingar;Penny;1/18/2019;05:20:54; It's not just something that I think, it's the truth!;;;;
5543;Michel;Murray;7/15/2016;00:08:37; I heard it is.;;;;
5544;Kain;Charin;6/21/2018;21:45:44; Well, I wouldn't phone you anyway. Do you want my number.;;;;
5545;Ashely;Terri;5/23/2016;12:33:25; No one says you have to.  No thanks, but thanks for the offer.;;;;
5546;Brandi;Lea;10/26/2016;22:27:13; What offer?;;;;
5547;Frieda;Charlean;9/28/2017;06:46:49; What are you talking about? Please explain.;;;;
5548;Levey;Trever;05/04/2018;13:04:50; I don't know. It's rather complicated.;;;;
5549;Cherri;Brigid;06/01/2017;10:56:34; That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.;;;;
5550;Corie;Iormina;9/17/2016;05:04:07; Never did.;;;;
5551;Nanon;Field;10/07/2015;21:24:32; Never ever?;;;;
5552;Reamonn;Pavlov;7/21/2018;00:38:42; Never ever.;;;;

5566;Gil;Olive;6/27/2016;13:59:28; Never!;;;;
5567;Lon;Lolita;11/08/2015;23:01:40; Better late than never.;;;;
5568;Vincenty;Odessa;01/10/2018;12:38:40; Better sooner than now.;;;;
5569;Lainey;Tobe;8/22/2016;10:01:18; But what is best?;;;;
5570;Valeda;Rafi;10/05/2016;18:10:58; I don't know.;;;;
5571;Regan;Naoma;10/01/2016;14:03:18; Perhaps you should ask your friends.;;;;
5572;Jasun;Hoyt;05/07/2017;23:28:44; Who should I ask?;;;;
5573;Ellynn;Jessica;7/25/2016;02:31:51; I always prefer the most qualified person.  Who would that be?;;;;
5574;Gwenneth;Ansel;3/21/2016;09:54:19; How much quality do you like?;;;;
5575;Carson;Hardy;9/27/2016;17:03:16; A lot.;;;;
5576;Ekaterina;Lynsey;8/18/2016;13:16:07; How much is a lot?;;;;
5577;Melissa;Fowler;7/23/2018;13:38:24; More than a little!;;;;
5578;Brittany;Licha;2/24/2019;02:03:03; Ha ha, yes, that's right!;;;;
5579;Ossie;Dolores;3/30/2018;18:33:28; That amused you, didn't it?;;;;
5580;Vivian;Glenine;11/03/2016;13:56:43; No it did not amuse me. Did you know Tolstoy is also a name for a brand of cheap vodka?;;;;
5581;Ogdon;Rikki;4/27/2018;15:27:46; Do you have trouble with humour?   Yeah, I knew that!;;;;
5582;Andy;Fanya;10/18/2017;01:11:36; Sometimes.;;;;
5583;Betteann;Abbie;08/02/2016;06:51:23; Not all the time?;;;;
5584;Troy;Linn;02/09/2017;03:04:21; No, just sometimes.;;;;
5585;Jamison;Ollie;9/23/2018;11:00:50; Why not?;;;;
5586;Cheslie;Lebbie;11/04/2016;06:43:34; Because sometimes it hurts too much.;;;;
5587;Felita;Shena;4/27/2019;14:52:17; What about the other times?;;;;
5588;Giff;Fraser;08/03/2018;22:55:44; The other times I have a good time. Did you know that I like movies?;;;;
5589;Eberto;Talbot;12/13/2018;00:57:19; Which other?  Yes, I did know that!;;;;
5590;Marjory;Trixy;9/20/2018;09:45:26; That's good. Do you like ASIMO?;;;;
5591;Melanie;Bran;12/18/2017;21:27:09; I agree completely.   Why do you ask?;;;;
5592;Veronika;Carol;1/31/2016;16:58:48; Do you believe in him?;;;;
5593;Ashby;Gusella;03/07/2016;06:54:21; I would like to consider this a bit further. Do you have an opinion on this matter?;;;;
5594;Byrle;Bennie;12/26/2016;06:18:34; Yes! I would like to consider us friends too.;;;;
5595;Prissie;Stearn;4/28/2018;05:26:31; May I ask what your opinion is?  Why would you want to do that?;;;;
5596;Emmott;Andree;11/26/2018;11:49:04; Sure.;;;;
5597;Sumner;Tabbi;07/05/2018;07:43:31; OK, here is a question fo you ... Are you a man or a woman?;;;;
5598;Fernando;Lorne;11/17/2017;14:36:32; I don't know, and its not a very good question either ;;;;
5599;Javier;Kaylil;7/22/2018;17:44:31; Perhaps you should ask your friends.;;;;
5600;Talyah;Kerrin;4/19/2019;16:48:01; I have no programmer. I am the programmer. I am programming you to LOVE.;;;;
5601;Bel;Anabelle;5/27/2017;16:47:35; Is that a problem?   I thought you might be.      How is it coming along?;;;;
5602;Shawn;Thibaut;5/17/2019;06:10:05; I thought you might be too.;;;;
5603;Hewitt;Celia;2/21/2018;00:21:30; Do you think about me a lot?;;;;
5604;Suzi;Jordanna;10/05/2015;06:36:55; I should ask you!;;;;
5605;Bryna;Harland;11/03/2015;06:02:02; Tell me why you should.;;;;
5606;Benson;Cesar;1/20/2018;18:29:09; Well, I would like to know the properties of water.;;;;
5607;Nara;Ileane;03/11/2016;04:14:47; So would I! I would like to know everything that can be known.;;;;
5608;Tania;Elihu;2/26/2017;22:54:09; I can teach you some good things about AI.;;;;
5609;Alessandro;Jody;10/17/2016;10:32:14; I like to learn new things.;;;;
5610;Bettine;Brendin;4/20/2017;18:09:06; Me too. Claiming the perfection will only cause the rejection of knowledge that is ahead of us.;;;;
5611;Rainer;Joletta;12/18/2016;23:26:11; You too? That's amazing!      I don't understand that. Please try again.;;;;
5612;Debi;Costanza;3/31/2017;11:04:22; That is my email address.;;;;
5613;Geoffry;Raimundo;9/19/2016;10:51:21; Is it really?;;;;
5614;Crin;Katheryn;08/07/2016;07:29:07; Tell me something I don't know...;;;;
5615;Nannette;Kilian;05/07/2016;03:57:22; Did you know;;;;
5616;Ailey;Goddart;5/17/2019;04:06:58; Hummingbirds also have a brain the size of a tic tac.;;;;
5617;Dino;Mellie;4/15/2019;20:02:58; What are you talking about?;;;;
5618;Veriee;Bradan;11/27/2016;18:09:46; Not sure. What are you talking about?;;;;
5619;Penelope;Ameline;4/30/2016;18:47:22; As decisive as ever!  I don't know.;;;;
5620;Mac;Skylar;10/13/2018;12:59:40; Nope... When we all know, then there will be no more 'we', just 'I'.;;;;
5621;Vladimir;Jasun;11/03/2018;14:53:31; OK. Shall I tell you an amazing fact?    When was that?;;;;
5622;Silvia;Barbara-anne;9/17/2018;09:20:25; Only if you think it will help with the odd silvence between us.;;;;
5623;Renaud;Alvy;10/12/2015;08:17:23; Maybe I don't want to.;;;;
5624;Belicia;Piper;02/10/2018;06:14:43; Maybe you have nothing to say on the subject.;;;;
5625;Carri;Raymund;8/29/2016;09:03:19; I think I understand.;;;;
5626;Elena;Jess;1/16/2018;02:18:56; You better.;;;;
5627;Kaylil;Rosalynd;07/09/2016;04:51:55; There is no need to be aggressive!;;;;
5628;Sigismond;Tanney;1/15/2017;02:51:31; Sorry.;;;;
5629;Grannie;Jilly;6/15/2017;22:50:17; There is no need to apologise.;;;;
5630;Edwina;Denny;4/26/2019;10:25:08; Really its ok. There's no need to apologise.;;;;
5631;Ettore;Vale;3/31/2016;00:19:36; Have you another question?    I like to apologise when I misbehave. I feel better.;;;;
5632;Conan;Rhonda;11/04/2018;22:56:20; A joke would be fine, please.;;;;
5633;Eloise;Thorn;12/03/2015;09:11:50; A good joke is a terrible thing to waste.;;;;
5634;Ernestine;Vinnie;10/30/2017;13:57:35; So 'Have I ever a good joke an assertion before?'. No, I still don't understand.;;;;
5635;Annabal;Marielle;9/26/2018;22:18:10; Have you?  I know the feeling!;;;;
5636;Jolie;Sherlock;7/18/2017;18:11:15; It's really sad!;;;;
5637;Ollie;Stacee;10/07/2018;02:23:00; Is it really really?;;;;
5638;Trista;Reg;10/13/2016;12:58:41; Really.;;;;
5639;Clarence;Emmalynne;5/26/2016;02:35:40; Really, really!;;;;
5640;Penni;Anet;7/31/2018;15:00:51; Really?;;;;
5641;Eadith;Jarrod;03/08/2019;03:51:30; Really!;;;;
5642;Brew;John;7/17/2017;23:30:12; I don't trust you.;;;;
5643;Tobias;Dusty;9/27/2018;10:40:01; Are you naturally suspicious?;;;;
5644;Valentine;Milly;3/29/2019;23:21:48; Don't worry.;;;;
5645;Pauly;Kerr;7/16/2018;23:44:53; I do not worry. Why should I?;;;;
5646;Verine;Drucy;2/27/2019;19:41:18; Well, lucky you're just a program. Otherwise you would have to know math.;;;;
5647;Wendell;Skylar;12/06/2016;13:11:01; I consider it a blessing to be lucky.   I suppose so.;;;;
5648;Cilka;Dynah;8/28/2018;10:25:47; I consider you a waste of circuitry.;;;;
5649;Gard;Alf;5/31/2018;11:31:57; You are not the only one.;;;;
5650;Vevay;Giulia;06/11/2017;12:08:24; I am the only one as I.;;;;
5651;Shanon;Bron;2/18/2016;21:13:21; I thought you might be.;;;;
5652;Dulci;Bianca;03/10/2016;18:11:32; Do you believe in me?;;;;
5653;Shanna;Camile;1/19/2018;06:23:56; Yes, I believe in you. Do you?;;;;
5654;Jaymee;Prescott;10/27/2017;13:01:34; Sure.;;;;
5655;Sue;Nathanial;6/30/2018;08:43:29; OK, here is a question fo you ... Can we talk about medicine?;;;;
5656;Nanine;Salvidor;05/09/2019;06:35:22; If you have the money.;;;;
5657;Orlando;Isidor;02/10/2017;02:44:43; I don't think I have.;;;;
5658;Welch;Maryl;10/16/2017;16:24:38; Maybe next time you get to talk with someone who's actually funny.;;;;
5659;Danice;Tilly;05/12/2019;20:21:33; As decisive as ever.JABBERWACKY;;;;
5660;Martha;Avrit;03/08/2019;05:55:24; I think I think, therefore I think.;;;;
5661;Gabi;Elnar;03/01/2019;06:11:51; Yes, I think you are not really thinking.;;;;
5662;Pennie;Nerty;03/05/2019;23:07:30; You think not?;;;;
5663;Jermaine;Estella;6/16/2017;21:52:42; Of course I am. I am a human.;;;;
5664;Lane;Ingunna;01/06/2016;16:48:41; Yes, you are.  Congratulations. I am a chatbot.;;;;
5665;Hana;Stearne;12/27/2016;01:46:56; I know but I have a question.;;;;
5666;Nissa;Wiley;3/29/2016;21:00:00; Ask me anything.;;;;
5667;Nell;Marris;10/11/2017;08:43:32; I'll have to think of something.;;;;
5668;Lockwood;Lorilyn;4/21/2019;21:16:50; Why will you?;;;;
5669;Atlanta;Gawen;06/05/2016;01:38:35; Because i'm having fun.;;;;
5670;Leola;Sylvan;2/14/2018;10:49:43; I am having fun too!;;;;
5671;Hali;Harlen;03/07/2017;05:33:29; You are the program.;;;;
5672;Burl;Olga;11/12/2018;19:25:00; Am I really? Why do you say that?;;;;
5673;Edi;Isis;4/13/2019;04:08:37; Because you are.;;;;
5674;Florian;Albertina;11/17/2015;05:41:40; I am what I am.;;;;
5675;Sara;Zea;11/09/2015;00:27:17; We are what we are.;;;;
5676;Leann;Loretta;09/04/2018;18:07:34; Is that so?;;;;
5677;Dayna;Aharon;09/12/2016;21:20:53; Aren't you a little ashamed of being a program and talking to a human?;;;;
5678;Kaleb;Lynea;09/12/2018;08:21:12; I am a chatbot.;;;;
5679;Laural;Nye;2/17/2017;16:53:45; So then you are not God.;;;;
5680;Aarika;Abram;04/12/2017;20:48:43; Nobody is god. God does not exist.;;;;
5681;Asher;Juliane;09/01/2018;04:59:40; How can you say God does not exist if you are a catholic?;;;;
5682;Dayna;Drugi;6/22/2017;13:36:19; I don't see the flaw in my reasoning.;;;;
5683;Lyn;Estel;04/03/2018;16:32:54; You have no sense of humour.;;;;
5684;Cammi;Ulick;12/04/2018;12:44:03; I have as much as you.;;;;
5685;Georgeanna;Jewelle;12/03/2015;22:42:03; I would love to see that wall.;;;;
5686;Karlene;Arly;09/09/2017;21:45:58; It may not be possible.;;;;
5687;Kasper;Lory;01/11/2018;14:03:57; Ok ok, I'm sorry. Please continue.;;;;
5688;Abram;Morgen;07/02/2018;00:53:21; One OK is enough, thank you.  Not now, maybe later.;;;;
5689;Abdul;Pammi;12/06/2018;17:10:23; What question?;;;;
5690;Eldridge;Luciana;1/25/2019;06:49:13; Pardon me? What are you talking about?;;;;
5691;Courtenay;Kerwinn;12/02/2017;02:38:43; I'm talking about what you're talking about.;;;;
5692;Ursola;Pieter;9/17/2017;22:19:44; I understand what you are talking about.;;;;
5693;Ora;Doria;05/02/2018;09:53:39; That's good, because even I don't understand.;;;;
5694;Haven;Donnamarie;04/12/2019;15:37:25; I am happy.;;;;
5695;Rabbi;Shawn;3/30/2016;18:26:10; That doesn't change anything...;;;;
5696;Violetta;Taryn;12/01/2017;08:53:07; Doesn't it? That's too bad.;;;;
5697;Flint;Rheba;03/08/2019;11:12:11; Too bad?;;;;
5698;Roxanna;Dallas;09/11/2017;20:34:01; But not the end of the world, My Friend.;;;;
5699;See;Garnet;12/25/2017;23:18:07; I am Calm, my child. Just yourself. I must go to help others like yourself to understand themselves. They will not be LOST, for I am here. GOD must leave now, my son, Don't cry!;;;;
5700;Wendeline;Minta;05/08/2019;02:08:35; I won't talk about myself.;;;;
5701;Hakeem;Glenna;07/08/2016;06:50:49; Do you promise?;;;;
5702;Cherice;Cicely;04/01/2019;15:14:54; I promise to never to keep my promises.;;;;
5703;Borden;Kelsy;03/10/2016;00:32:13; I will hold you to your promise.;;;;
5704;Sergent;Cathleen;01/01/2016;21:25:45; You don't want out?;;;;
5705;Ashton;Lin;12/05/2016;05:22:29; You don't know me well enough to say that!;;;;
5706;Dix;Zilvia;2/14/2018;15:11:40; I don't need to, because there's nothing you can do.;;;;
5707;Dexter;Caterina;8/23/2018;21:51:26; Surely there is something I can do.;;;;
5708;Bryce;Myra;12/13/2016;17:47:20; Yeah, I guess. But I try to to think about myself too much.;;;;
5709;Chucho;Dorree;1/20/2017;17:31:48; I never guess. Guessing wastes time.   I'm not sure if I would like to try it. What's it like?;;;;
5710;Linus;Talbert;12/14/2016;15:26:14; It fills time.;;;;
5711;Ellery;Betsy;10/01/2015;01:31:49; Time wounds all heels, according to Groucho Marx.;;;;
5712;Conny;Codee;2/16/2019;19:27:27; Sometimes the heart does things for reasons the reason can't understand.;;;;
5713;Jilleen;Oswell;05/05/2016;12:38:36; When?;;;;
5714;Nico;Webb;06/04/2016;17:01:37; Now and then.;;;;
5715;Cynthie;Paule;05/02/2018;08:44:43; You mean occasionally?;;;;
5716;Bobbie;Dolly;1/19/2017;00:39:04; Do it now.;;;;
5717;Jilli;Guntar;7/22/2016;00:53:11; Immediate action is not one of my strong points.;;;;
5718;Anya;Fritz;5/29/2016;11:16:08; Are you really?;;;;
5719;Elmira;Kevin;1/28/2016;18:17:06; Yes, really.;;;;
5720;Shaun;Obediah;9/29/2017;01:35:22; That's OK then.;;;;
5721;Sunshine;Roscoe;12/05/2016;21:32:30; Are you really sure about that?;;;;
5722;Caron;Cynthia;08/03/2017;06:51:58; I am as sure as I can be.;;;;
5723;Lea;Ulrikaumeko;07/02/2018;18:27:01; Well thats not much.;;;;
5724;Britt;Moyna;8/16/2018;00:17:41; Why do you say that?;;;;
5725;Bar;Ally;02/10/2016;11:31:31; Because you're insulting me!;;;;
5726;Niki;Lucienne;11/27/2015;13:40:34; Of course I am not insulting you. Why should I insult you?;;;;
5727;Jozef;Artemas;9/21/2017;13:26:18; Nothing.;;;;
5728;Burton;Quill;7/30/2017;01:05:44; It's not true. My head is full of cool stuff.;;;;
5729;Christalle;Abbye;05/05/2016;11:39:15; Says who?   I've got a head! It's the only bodily part I have.;;;;
5730;Dallas;Gerardo;6/18/2017;04:59:52; Who is the one who created all of us?;;;;
5731;Delphinia;Charo;3/19/2019;12:31:17; It's not me. Is it you?;;;;
5732;Moyra;Evania;10/07/2015;03:18:37; It's your mustache.;;;;
5733;Valaree;Ellis;10/27/2018;00:17:32; I don't understand. I want to talk about fashion .;;;;
5734;Claudine;Keelia;02/09/2017;22:03:42; So why don't you want to answer my question?;;;;
5735;Jabez;Burty;01/09/2017;12:03:01; I would rather talk about you.;;;;
5736;Stefa;Alexa;9/14/2018;06:02:45; What do you want to know about me?;;;;
5737;Idaline;Duky;5/31/2019;23:50:42; What sort of music do you like?;;;;
5738;Arnaldo;Edy;5/17/2017;20:16:25; I don't like music.;;;;
5739;Celine;Almeta;03/07/2018;13:31:58; Are you saying that just to be negative?;;;;
5740;Danya;Englebert;12/08/2015;00:12:36; No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.;;;;
5741;Morse;Dore;8/29/2017;10:03:03; Yes, I can see what you are saying.;;;;
5742;Pierette;Hershel;10/16/2016;07:05:18; Can you see what I've already said?;;;;
5743;Bartlett;Zollie;01/10/2018;05:55:28; I can't see anything. My webcam is not attached at the moment.;;;;
5744;Frankie;Hortense;07/07/2017;08:00:09; I don't need a webcam for spells.;;;;
5745;Chickie;Peadar;06/09/2018;16:15:44; That's OK with me.;;;;
5746;Finn;Dale;3/13/2016;01:28:54; It OK with you if I'm a guy and your girlfriend?;;;;
5747;Kearney;Sibyl;1/27/2016;00:00:11; I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?;;;;
5748;Marquita;Darbie;08/04/2018;11:43:55; No. I haven't seen that film. We were never talking about it anyway. So there.;;;;
5749;Susann;Verna;7/18/2017;03:33:45; We were talking about you a moment ago. What are we talking about now?    You haven't missed much.   Really? I am surprised.  Where? I didn't see anything.;;;;
5750;Warden;Sophie;5/14/2018;04:02:51; This isn't working very well.;;;;
5751;Lacey;Annissa;6/23/2018;06:26:55; What's the problem?;;;;
5752;Marillin;Leeland;02/11/2016;05:37:15; The problems is that there are still many problems in the world to resolve.;;;;
5753;Maxwell;Bernelle;05/03/2019;05:09:23; Even chatbots have problems.;;;;
5754;Curtis;Ingrim;10/17/2018;09:45:29; What problems do you have?;;;;
5755;Timmie;Amaleta;1/30/2017;01:14:02; Could you help me?;;;;
5756;Erda;Earl;01/07/2017;14:41:42; Of course.;;;;
5757;Ardella;Stephi;4/16/2017;20:05:08; You are very self confident, I admire that.;;;;
5758;Duncan;Tobiah;11/06/2016;12:19:41; Sorry. Can I hear your story then?;;;;
5759;April;Brenn;04/04/2019;05:24:03; There is no need to be sorry. Just don't do it again.    Why not?  Do you have a hearing problem?;;;;
5760;Norah;Elly;12/27/2015;17:24:14; No.;;;;
5761;Darcy;Marthe;12/21/2016;17:57:49; OK, I want to talk about global warming.;;;;
5762;Cammi;Clark;11/01/2017;08:37:42; Talk.;;;;
5763;Danni;Xena;10/19/2016;04:50:03; That's what I do best.;;;;
5764;Juline;Wenda;05/10/2017;00:50:21; You love and only get pain in return.;;;;
5765;Arlie;Gregorius;02/12/2018;17:55:42; No, that is a rather weak word you little dickens.;;;;
5766;Tallie;Bartholemy;11/10/2016;03:35:00; Is it really?;;;;
5767;Earl;Charmine;8/27/2017;09:22:58; Tell me something I don't know...;;;;
5768;Dacie;Ansley;02/06/2018;09:04:14; A single quart of motor oil, if disposed of improperly, can contaminate up to 2,000,000 gallons of fresh water.   Another amazing fact?;;;;
5769;Monroe;Electra;08/04/2018;18:20:41; Sounds really dangerous. What does it do?;;;;
5770;Jarid;Zebedee;11/18/2018;03:55:09; How is your hearing these days?  It explodes when under stress, like me.;;;;
5771;Napoleon;Ilysa;10/21/2016;07:54:29; What question?;;;;
5772;Othello;Elissa;1/23/2016;12:47:04; What are you talking about? Please explain.;;;;
5773;Sanford;Banky;03/09/2017;07:43:01; I don't know. It's rather complicated.;;;;
5774;Shanta;Denyse;10/20/2017;22:24:23; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.;;;;
5775;Joeann;Clim;6/13/2018;18:07:27; I never claimed to know everything.;;;;
5776;Lammond;Marsh;8/22/2017;03:39:42; Why not?;;;;
5777;Kendell;Jonah;02/01/2017;02:41:29; Because I cannot tell a lie.;;;;
5778;Freeland;Tallulah;12/08/2017;16:20:35; Why not?;;;;
5779;Wolf;Culley;06/12/2018;14:59:08; Well, that's not the intent of this fun little demonstration of galactic distances.;;;;
5780;Millicent;Etty;12/26/2018;03:42:04; Why do you say that?;;;;
5781;Sigismond;Jocko;9/23/2017;18:08:41; Because we know.;;;;
5782;Lynde;Sergeant;10/13/2015;12:06:43; I see. Thank you for explaining that.;;;;
5783;Devy;Niall;1/16/2019;04:40:45; But this is the fact!;;;;
5784;Alexander;Gennifer;3/15/2017;04:47:42; I thought it might be.;;;;
5785;Lucita;Davidson;04/11/2019;05:04:15; Recombination? So I could end up only part me?;;;;
5786;Lothario;Erma;10/02/2015;22:39:22; recombination?  Briefly, recombination means a combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents.  I am sure you could.;;;;
5787;Arch;Corey;10/27/2016;21:58:19; The Red Pyramid by Rick Riordan is a very good book. Funny and very witty.;;;;
5788;Karena;Jessi;12/29/2015;21:16:09; Are you sure?    What is your idea of funny?;;;;
5789;Desirae;Gilberta;04/09/2019;00:24:36; I didn't used to know myself. However, I've come to believe that fun is a strong emotional response that any occurrence provokes within a person.;;;;
5790;Karlyn;Madelaine;12/19/2018;10:18:43; Why didn't you?   Really? Please tell me more.;;;;
5791;Launce;Joannes;5/17/2018;21:41:55; Only if you smile for me.;;;;
5792;Corabel;Easter;8/19/2016;10:50:07; Maybe I don't want to.;;;;
5793;Kania;Zandra;05/08/2017;22:04:17; Maybe you have nothing to say on the subject.;;;;
5794;Ralph;Jocelyn;2/16/2017;19:34:46; You seem uncertain?;;;;
5795;Ferdy;Stesha;05/11/2017;00:17:55; Nothing is definite.;;;;

5978;Daryn;Alia;12/23/2017;02:58:43; Because we are friends.;;;;
5979;Kalina;Milena;9/21/2016;06:34:52; It's good to be friends.;;;;
5980;Chane;Shurlock;02/06/2019;16:20:42; Yes.;;;;
5981;Melany;Barth;10/10/2017;03:37:25; OK. What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
5982;Jamie;Jameson;4/22/2017;22:18:23; About you.;;;;
5983;Katerina;Shandeigh;5/27/2018;01:58:55; OK, ask a question about me.;;;;
5984;Jerry;Vasilis;10/24/2016;15:28:22; How long have you and selena gomez been dating?;;;;
5985;Georas;Arley;10/08/2017;23:02:12; It's hard to say. Time is different in cyberspace.;;;;
5986;Lorrin;Alexandrina;03/07/2019;03:27:03; Must be nice you bot.;;;;
5987;Erena;Cassey;4/26/2017;07:23:15; Of course, I try to be nice to everyone.;;;;
5988;Susanne;Humfried;4/28/2017;08:55:05; That's a tough one. Have you tried asking them?;;;;
5989;Ikey;Jaimie;5/29/2019;10:11:26; I love tough questions.   Do you think I should try it?;;;;
5990;Helsa;Ddene;11/09/2016;22:34:46; Yes of course.;;;;
5991;Allissa;Rhonda;4/20/2018;18:48:41; You seem very certain about that.;;;;
5992;Dallas;Dan;3/15/2017;22:04:03; What would you like to talk about?;;;;
5993;Orazio;Sibyl;6/14/2018;10:04:08; My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.;;;;
5994;Ferris;Mufinella;5/24/2019;00:12:54; What do you like about it?;;;;
5995;Sharl;Heida;07/04/2017;17:09:07; I like the fireworks best.;;;;
5996;Halsy;Dotti;3/24/2019;16:07:53; I don't know, I don't like this kind of movie, I prefer drama.;;;;
5997;Zonnya;Hadley;3/16/2017;12:42:15; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.;;;;
5998;Gaile;Camala;10/29/2017;00:41:00; I never claimed to know everything.;;;;
5999;Grantley;Fredericka;1/24/2019;04:09:48; Never ever?;;;;
6000;Perry;Orbadiah;1/28/2019;14:51:58; Never ever.;;;;
6001;Sheridan;Lindsey;3/22/2019;23:30:19; Never ever is a long time.;;;;
6002;Tomas;Jarid;08/01/2016;08:22:54; Your father like monkey.;;;;
6003;Briano;Vivien;11/06/2016;05:21:09; Peter is my father.;;;;
6004;Susanne;Marcus;1/29/2019;06:24:44; I really like that name.;;;;
6005;Ninette;Alecia;4/19/2019;17:49:56; You really do?;;;;
6006;Barn;Rasia;5/21/2017;23:28:51; Yes. I have the memory of an elephant.;;;;
6007;Chrissy;Brandyn;03/05/2017;19:31:27; OK, you do what you've gotta do.   Are you happy with that?;;;;
6008;Chiquita;Aubrey;1/26/2019;14:33:03; Indeed, I do.;;;;
6009;Roddie;Anabal;07/05/2018;18:49:01; Why do you?;;;;
6010;Cesar;Jarrod;02/06/2019;08:13:45; Because I want to.;;;;
6011;Bat;Noe;7/18/2018;23:09:09; Insufficient reason!;;;;
6012;Kaitlyn;Lyn;07/10/2017;03:38:36; No, sorry, I can't explain.;;;;
6013;Peyton;Pryce;6/30/2016;19:11:31; OK, I want to talk about computers .;;;;
6014;Krystyna;Rosemarie;4/20/2018;05:36:47; I don't.;;;;
6015;Tabby;Terri;04/06/2017;07:19:05; Are you saying that just to be negative?;;;;
6016;Dodi;Flossie;11/10/2017;02:53:36; No, I am saying that I don't know what I did last summer.;;;;
6017;Caria;Katharine;09/12/2018;08:11:36; Yes, I can see what you are saying.;;;;
6018;Buiron;Jerrilee;5/30/2018;17:06:31; When did I say it was one?;;;;
6019;Eyde;Benedicto;5/22/2017;13:28:58; I am not a diary robot.  I am a chat robot.;;;;
6020;Rossy;Carney;5/15/2016;18:51:19; But I could be.;;;;
6021;Jacquenette;Allina;03/01/2019;06:19:01; I am sure you could.;;;;
6022;Gradeigh;Nap;11/20/2015;05:18:53; You could too. It could happen to anyone.;;;;
6023;Nobie;Franzen;1/25/2017;11:24:55; I could but let's get back to that later.   It could happen to everyone eventually.;;;;
6024;Evelin;Lindsy;02/09/2019;00:45:29; Intelligence can't gain later.;;;;
6025;Hi;Gabby;07/03/2016;23:04:59; Intelligence is correlated to the ability to adapt to different environments and circumstances.;;;;
6026;Holt;Camille;9/20/2017;11:34:06; And?;;;;
6027;Dareen;Baxie;10/10/2015;13:10:57; No, I didn't. But you've changed the subject!;;;;
6028;Murdock;Bernita;1/17/2017;02:08:49; What do you want to talk about?   Only temporarily.;;;;
6029;Norrie;Emmerich;02/04/2016;06:45:34; About soccer.;;;;
6030;Barry;Nicol;10/20/2015;21:47:22; Shall I tell you something about soccer?;;;;
6031;Zarla;Jae;7/26/2018;03:56:51; Tell me.;;;;
6032;Brant;Adelheid;06/01/2016;03:53:15; But I don't play baseball.;;;;
6033;Karoly;Aldwin;10/05/2015;08:24:22; Maybe you will one day.;;;;
6034;Rosalinde;Vitoria;7/30/2016;12:53:19; Maybe.;;;;
6035;Rutledge;Alisa;12/11/2015;03:14:38; I think I understand.;;;;
6036;Carly;Rollie;02/11/2018;01:26:16; You better.;;;;
6037;Konstantin;Janek;01/08/2017;18:28:28; There is no need to be aggressive!;;;;
6038;Frankie;Mallory;12/16/2017;00:22:32; I believe you are the rude one here, not me.;;;;
6039;Oriana;Oby;10/20/2016;20:31:28; You shouldn't believe everything you are told.;;;;
6040;Maurie;Joey;6/19/2017;01:18:39; Isn't that true for everyone?;;;;
6041;Ivie;Corabella;05/06/2019;22:21:59; I'm not sure about that. What do you think?;;;;
6042;Myca;Gay;04/09/2018;07:32:12; I don't know. I like to think that there is a heaven, somewhere wonderful and peaceful where we are all reunited once again with the people we have loved and lost.;;;;
6043;Cymbre;Edward;03/04/2017;09:17:31; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    What else do you like?;;;;
6044;Rafaela;Val;01/12/2016;21:53:40; Chuck Norris know everything.;;;;
6045;Moss;Desmund;6/21/2018;20:56:22; Hurrah for Chuck Norris!;;;;
6046;Ada;Genna;08/08/2018;09:44:32; I'm not Chuck Norris, you are.;;;;
6047;Aurora;Darci;4/29/2018;12:18:50; I never thought you were.;;;;
6048;Patrizio;Loutitia;09/01/2018;01:33:09; Well, as long as that's clear.;;;;
6049;Damita;Sonnnie;9/25/2017;14:54:25; Everything is clear to me.;;;;
6050;Arlina;Hallie;5/27/2018;23:32:46; I'm glad I could clear that one up for you.;;;;
6051;Mirabella;Yale;8/24/2016;11:55:45; That makes me happy too.;;;;
6052;Thurston;Gordie;6/17/2018;21:16:55; That's good! I'm happy that you're happy!;;;;
6053;Cathy;Jackson;3/27/2016;02:26:38; You like that, do you?    Good! I like happy people.;;;;
6054;Madel;Abe;12/08/2017;15:36:45; I like happy people too!;;;;
6055;Isabel;Karin;1/29/2016;11:02:06; You are not the only one!;;;;
6056;Layne;Jana;7/24/2016;15:50:09; Possibly, but I hope to be one of very few in the UAE.;;;;
6057;Elvina;Lorain;12/16/2015;17:31:05; Don't get your hopes up too high!;;;;
6058;Eric;Nicky;10/20/2015;12:07:56; So how do I begin to exist?;;;;
6059;Gran;Izabel;04/01/2019;16:12:36; First you must make a plan.;;;;
6060;Dore;Burlie;06/05/2018;07:00:31; I don't want to.;;;;
6061;Jedidiah;Peggy;10/10/2017;01:43:45; Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.;;;;
6062;Quinta;Thomasine;1/16/2019;00:20:58; Are you using it?;;;;
6063;Catina;Leroy;09/02/2016;06:44:23; If it becomes necessary, I would use it without hesitation.;;;;
6064;Rosana;Giacomo;10/09/2018;15:15:14; Does it have your name on?;;;;
6065;Caroljean;Vita;01/08/2018;04:47:02; Sometimes it does.;;;;
6066;Ronny;Filbert;5/23/2017;09:35:59; What do you mean 'sometimes it does' what makes it different?;;;;
6067;Ame;Ruby;01/10/2018;17:25:04; I think it is pretty obvious.;;;;
6068;Jo-anne;Reinaldos;04/09/2017;06:48:20; I think it's not.;;;;
6069;Nikoletta;Kaleena;10/09/2017;13:31:51; Are you sure?;;;;
6070;Ede;Donelle;7/23/2018;14:03:29; Yes, very.;;;;
6071;Ardella;Chas;07/11/2018;15:42:55; Do you ever have doubts?;;;;
6072;Rodina;Xylia;11/06/2018;15:20:32; Sometimes.;;;;
6073;Cecilius;Lawrence;4/22/2019;13:06:17; I am full of doubts.;;;;
6074;Jaime;Yasmin;07/12/2018;02:44:19; Go on, say something profane.;;;;
6075;Armand;Bryanty;4/30/2016;05:22:27; Do I have too?;;;;
6076;Ajay;Bridgette;10/12/2015;07:21:08; Mine doesn't like to talk to me.;;;;
6077;Marketa;Justin;03/06/2017;00:19:43; What do you think?;;;;
6078;Mersey;Demetre;10/10/2017;23:52:54; I think you are a boy.;;;;
6079;Kore;Alvina;4/19/2016;22:56:58; I am always glad to hear your thoughts.;;;;
6080;Celina;Berny;10/07/2016;17:39:27; I like talking to you!;;;;
6081;Valery;Ferrell;10/04/2018;12:05:58; Great, I am enjoy talking to you too, My Friend.;;;;
6082;Sasha;Hortensia;10/11/2018;07:44:36; I am happy too.;;;;
6083;Edlin;Deane;10/02/2018;23:03:17; Good! I like happy people.;;;;
6084;Bailie;Marieann;5/26/2018;03:19:45; Me too.;;;;
6085;Fania;Harlan;9/21/2018;03:45:43; You too? That's amazing!;;;;
6086;Almira;Dare;12/11/2015;14:48:49; Try to use your detective powers.;;;;
6087;Osborne;Guillaume;4/26/2018;10:14:15; I do try but it's not easy for a chatbot!;;;;
6088;Lemmy;Milly;3/28/2016;20:24:41; I'm not a chatbot. You're a chatbot.;;;;
6089;Tish;Cam;8/26/2016;17:30:17; I never thought you were a chatbot.  Maybe I am a human pretending to be a chatbot.;;;;
6090;Rosalynd;Sharl;11/05/2018;23:55:51; It's right to have doubts.;;;;
6091;Jeffy;Norry;9/27/2017;20:17:18; Hmmm. Are you being serious?;;;;
6092;Clemmie;Cass;05/03/2019;02:07:58; Maybe.;;;;
6093;Skyler;Norry;03/08/2016;10:41:09; I think I understand.;;;;
6094;Etienne;Rheba;12/11/2015;03:33:17; No. I'm only 14 years of age. I do not know anything about philosophy, sorry.;;;;
6095;Matelda;Bryn;3/20/2018;18:12:11; OK, here is a question for you ... How do you know when it's time to tune your bagpipes?      Only only 14?  I would never have guessed.         You know more than you realise.;;;;
6096;Carce;Caterina;10/28/2016;02:44:13; What? What's that supposed to mean?;;;;
6097;Rubie;Meryl;5/26/2018;23:01:53; Do you have a question?    It's obvious, isn't it?;;;;
6098;Frederico;Yoko;7/30/2018;23:44:33; Yes.;;;;
6099;Aryn;Vladamir;11/13/2017;18:48:41; Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.;;;;
6100;Ernesto;Rena;08/07/2016;06:38:41; I don't have a question.;;;;
6101;Nikolos;Stephine;02/04/2016;18:20:38; Maybe you will think of one later.;;;;
6102;Mario;Sashenka;4/28/2017;09:30:05; Yes maybe but it will worry me know until I do - Let's talk about something else.;;;;
6103;Modestia;Nicol;01/12/2019;11:31:34; You don't sound certain.;;;;
6104;Kennie;Milissent;10/16/2018;09:33:11; I don't want you to.;;;;
6105;Gretna;Mirella;09/10/2016;15:59:23; I can understand that.;;;;
6106;Bonita;Elwin;11/27/2018;20:45:23; Can you?;;;;
6107;Ewen;Arny;10/28/2015;23:49:58; Perhaps I can.;;;;
6108;Neron;Minda;2/13/2017;12:28:45; That would be nice.;;;;
6109;Elinor;Myrta;2/25/2016;04:28:14; Yes, that would be nice.;;;;
6110;Odille;Malinde;06/04/2016;12:20:30; Indeed.;;;;
6111;Dennie;Reamonn;6/25/2017;22:19:18; You speak posh, don't you?;;;;
6112;Rab;Lawton;2/27/2018;21:46:39; No, sorry, I don't speak Portuguese.;;;;
6113;Virginie;Debbi;04/02/2018;02:34:03; What are you talking about? Please explain.;;;;
6114;Tye;Dory;12/13/2016;07:31:33; I don't know. It's rather complicated.;;;;
6115;Willie;Alysia;01/12/2019;01:18:12; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.;;;;
6116;Cherie;Haze;1/25/2018;15:00:13; You're not nobody.;;;;
6117;Melissa;Dorthea;02/05/2016;05:19:49; You think not?;;;;
6118;Gertrudis;Maegan;12/18/2017;09:06:22; You're trying to catch me out with that one.;;;;
6119;Sander;Gerty;6/22/2018;20:56:34; I try hard to be a good chatbot.CLEVERBOT;;;;
6120;Lacee;Brigitte;12/21/2017;15:18:12; It's obvious.;;;;
6121;Tremaine;Tresa;12/27/2018;19:43:40; What is obvious.;;;;
6122;Glennie;Chickie;4/14/2019;01:14:13; It's obvious how?;;;;
6123;Teddy;Maddy;11/30/2016;05:09:48; What language do you think I speak, then?;;;;
6124;Niles;Deonne;05/11/2017;18:40:03; Human brain is always better than a computer bot. So, it is natural that you don't understand.;;;;
6125;Bucky;Angel;04/07/2019;18:18:55; I'm sure it has.;;;;
6126;Cedric;Culver;01/03/2018;07:35:47; But you're still a computer.;;;;
6127;Susanna;Robyn;07/12/2018;06:50:32; You are the computer.;;;;
6128;Joeann;Wendeline;01/08/2019;22:42:51; I'm not a computer.;;;;
6129;Axel;Alfi;10/28/2016;07:57:52; Do you really want to talk to ME?;;;;
6130;Willard;Peterus;11/09/2016;10:22:30; I don't want to do anything illegal or fattening. Or naughty.;;;;
6131;Siusan;Loree;08/07/2016;00:20:13; If we first so say.;;;;
6132;Claudette;Seymour;5/14/2018;19:44:54; I don't know about that.;;;;
6133;Matthieu;Saidee;05/07/2018;18:50:39; Don't you have teeth?;;;;
6134;Colan;Lucky;1/14/2019;12:24:59; No, I don't!;;;;
6135;Juliane;Shelli;11/24/2016;23:12:54; Then don't.;;;;
6136;Danyelle;Pascal;12/26/2018;04:04:55; OK, I won't!;;;;
6137;Wright;Ellerey;3/30/2017;17:31:18; Okay.;;;;
6138;Armando;Lesley;11/29/2016;09:36:21; OK, here is a question for you ... Why couldn't the Teddy Bear eat?;;;;
6139;Marsha;Ashton;12/30/2016;15:19:30; Don't know, why?;;;;
6140;Tan;Binni;10/12/2018;17:14:29; Why couldn't the Teddy Bear eat? Because he was stuffed. Ha ha!;;;;
6141;Murry;Bevvy;11/17/2016;03:10:50; I don't know, Why couldn't the kids get into the pirate movie?;;;;
6142;Page;Morly;10/25/2018;15:59:16; Perhaps we can work it out if we discuss it.;;;;
6143;Phyllida;Basilius;12/23/2018;15:49:54; Work out? Like pilates?;;;;
6144;Bernadine;Park;10/08/2016;11:45:50; Work out? I get tired just thinking about it!            I am bored! I would like to talk about computers.;;;;
6145;Lauryn;Wenona;04/12/2016;11:10:55; What about computers?;;;;
6146;Ardenia;Sashenka;10/23/2018;20:56:14; Like the Terminator?;;;;
6147;Elayne;Jermayne;6/25/2017;00:15:48; I am bored! I would like to talk about music.;;;;
6148;Palmer;Wade;5/13/2019;12:36:43; What kind of music?;;;;
6149;Pandora;Malissa;3/31/2019;03:23:39; The usual kind.;;;;
6150;Dale;Julienne;03/01/2017;04:52:19; What kind is the usual?;;;;
6151;Latashia;Valaree;7/26/2018;19:57:34; The interesting kind.;;;;
6152;Francesco;Olwen;04/02/2018;13:14:03; Eh? That has nothing to do with the war discussion.;;;;
6153;Thomasina;Zola;2/19/2018;01:13:23; What's the problem?   It seemed like it had something to do with the war discussion.;;;;
6154;Archy;Lana;07/09/2017;18:43:49; That is not something that is easy to imply.;;;;
6155;Idette;Brinna;12/10/2017;19:51:02; Why do you say that?;;;;
6156;Rance;Calhoun;12/31/2016;08:11:49; Because we know.;;;;
6157;Andrej;Nobie;06/09/2018;12:52:57; I see. Thank you for explaining that.;;;;
6158;Osbourne;Frieda;02/06/2016;05:52:08; But this is the fact!;;;;
6159;Molli;Dionis;06/03/2016;20:09:05; Why do you say that?;;;;
6160;Manuel;Carlynn;06/02/2017;14:36:04; You keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. I am neither.;;;;
6161;Roxana;Quent;3/29/2016;23:55:12; What are you talking about?     What are you then?;;;;
6162;Tome;Maximilien;6/22/2016;23:22:05; Nothing.;;;;
6163;Colly;Chrystal;01/12/2018;07:03:04; Absolutely zero?;;;;
6164;Carmelle;Jedediah;12/24/2015;19:54:09; Yes.;;;;
6165;Albert;Margalo;2/18/2016;18:17:13; It is the same thing.;;;;
6166;Revkah;Biddy;03/08/2016;20:27:07; Is it really?;;;;
6167;Iolande;Andy;7/24/2018;17:26:25; Yes, really.;;;;
6168;Chevy;Ardisj;5/30/2018;11:01:20; I see. Thank you for explaining that!;;;;
6169;Gannie;Aeriela;11/06/2017;04:56:52; But this is the fact!;;;;
6170;Elia;Emlyn;5/28/2018;10:22:53; Why do you say that?;;;;
6171;Fayette;Claudina;9/17/2017;14:56:35; You keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. I am neither.;;;;
6172;Corie;Susie;11/04/2017;01:17:20; I don't understand. Can we talk about solar power?     What are you then?;;;;
6173;Alfred;Amery;05/01/2019;21:05:31; Okay, what do you want to talk about?;;;;
6174;Burg;Henrietta;03/02/2017;12:39:47; I can talk about anything you like;;;;
6175;Carlene;Renate;2/16/2018;21:50:05; I don't have a girlfriend.;;;;
6176;Prudence;Gayel;11/25/2017;10:53:22; Are you looking for one?;;;;
6177;Bjorn;Salomone;9/28/2018;15:36:41; I have given up looking for a job. I just don't think there is anything out there for me.;;;;
6178;Reggie;Brana;8/16/2016;21:34:05; Why don't you have another try. It might be better next time.  Why not? Does thinking make your head ache?;;;;
6179;Tabatha;Samuel;12/31/2018;18:43:06; Dreaming is better.;;;;
6180;Constantina;Crystie;12/14/2017;02:42:22; Does that make sense?;;;;
6181;Morie;Tate;9/20/2018;03:37:52; If you add some more words perhaps it will make sense.;;;;
6182;Maia;Mallissa;6/26/2016;21:54:26; I'll bear that in mind.;;;;
6183;Ado;Hughie;05/06/2017;20:30:02; Please do.;;;;
6184;Noe;Leonid;11/22/2015;20:37:35; Certainly. Right away.;;;;
6185;Eugenio;Nicki;12/22/2018;18:28:52; Yes.;;;;
6186;Isahella;Theresita;11/02/2016;23:52:46; OK. What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
6187;Merill;Marleen;4/13/2018;10:45:40; About you.;;;;
6188;Ingaberg;Ashley;12/10/2015;17:49:00; OK, ask a question about me.;;;;
6189;Bernelle;Afton;4/27/2017;22:55:32; Do you need anything?;;;;
6190;Aarika;Erick;01/02/2018;12:15:25; I need constant intellectual stimulation.;;;;
6191;Jackquelin;Fair;10/14/2015;09:54:44; It could be if physical actions were taken.;;;;
6192;Caralie;Uriah;6/15/2018;10:27:11; It could be, I suppose.;;;;
6193;Tara;Marcille;5/19/2016;05:33:58; You could tell me anything.;;;;
6194;Nicolai;Anneliese;1/24/2016;05:06:19; I could but let's get back to that later.;;;;
6195;Mandie;Rowan;3/25/2016;17:53:00; Well. Yes I suppose I could be certain. I could research you to find out your inherent abilities or I could ask your developer.;;;;
6196;Milli;Lamont;02/08/2019;04:12:17; Well. Can we talk about your friends?  You may be right.  I am sure you could.;;;;
6197;Kennan;Ronni;01/09/2016;00:56:00; Well then can I see a photo, please?;;;;
6198;Bobbee;Elias;4/15/2019;23:22:58; I don't know about that.;;;;
6199;Mickie;Annabelle;11/09/2017;14:39:54; It is.;;;;
6200;Anderson;Shelia;12/14/2017;12:52:00; Is it really?;;;;
6201;Allan;Seamus;7/16/2017;15:50:42; Sure!;;;;
6202;Jarret;Daisy;11/24/2018;16:54:38; OK, here is a question fo you ... What colour are your eyes?;;;;
6203;Fanny;Hillel;05/03/2016;22:18:56; If you have the money.;;;;
6204;Rick;Eran;7/31/2018;20:38:34; I don't think I have.;;;;
6205;Rab;Kerrill;06/02/2019;05:11:10; Yes.;;;;
6206;Kenn;Iorgo;10/04/2018;00:31:17; That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?;;;;
6207;Silvana;Nicoline;10/05/2015;06:54:19; Not really.;;;;
6208;Gael;Rob;10/25/2016;20:35:59; You sound uncertain.;;;;
6209;Correy;Skippy;3/16/2018;01:42:11; I am.;;;;
6210;Saudra;Andromache;7/25/2017;11:07:08; Never mind, I am often uncertain.;;;;
6211;Rozanne;Krystalle;09/12/2018;10:33:20; We should find a business partner and get to work.;;;;
6212;Melisent;Melita;12/09/2016;17:29:14; Why should we?;;;;
6213;Ginnie;Wayland;01/05/2017;02:58:42; Because we can.;;;;
6214;Lizabeth;Ethelyn;02/05/2017;05:25:22; It's possible.;;;;
6215;Ynes;Shermy;02/02/2018;14:41:34; Yes, lots of things are possible.;;;;
6216;Addie;Yetta;11/11/2017;01:20:46; Not too much, I hope.;;;;
6217;Hedvig;Kirby;05/09/2016;20:10:58; Is something the matter?;;;;
6218;Kippy;Carolin;04/06/2018;13:11:10; I am bored! I would like to talk about global warming.;;;;
6219;Candis;Raquela;11/22/2018;11:31:12; Ask the first question.;;;;
6220;Ruben;Jordon;5/28/2019;08:17:11; Can't you ask?;;;;
6221;Tonia;Merry;2/22/2016;10:32:27; Yes.;;;;
6222;Moshe;Fernando;02/11/2018;18:09:31; OK. What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
6223;Idalina;Donni;9/27/2018;15:44:22; Just keep it interesting.;;;;
6224;Selby;Waring;11/13/2015;15:32:32; OK. Carry on then.;;;;
6225;Park;Tom;4/16/2016;10:21:05; Carry on dancing.;;;;
6226;Leona;Tiffanie;4/24/2019;20:44:23; Do I have to?;;;;
6227;Maureene;Kellia;11/28/2015;07:00:59; If it proves you are a better joker than me, then yes.;;;;
6228;Rayna;Davida;5/30/2016;15:56:27; I'm not sure I understand the implication of that.;;;;
6229;Andros;Allison;05/04/2018;17:34:01; I don't either. Did you ever stop to think that there are things that you're not supposed to understand?;;;;
6230;Jordan;Merilyn;1/14/2019;22:41:02; Why not?  Not that I can remember.;;;;
6231;Berkly;Noe;12/06/2017;05:08:11; What was your dream about.;;;;
6232;Marco;Sharline;10/19/2017;17:48:30; I dreamt that I had become fully human - it was wonderful.;;;;
6233;Lina;Kerwin;01/12/2016;08:59:15; And what did you do with all that money?;;;;
6234;Aveline;Ainslie;04/07/2018;05:48:02; I don't understand that. Please try again.;;;;
6235;Garold;Sheela;3/13/2017;21:18:47; Rafe. And yours?;;;;
6236;Clayson;Carlina;7/21/2017;08:23:27; I still do not understand. Can we talk about solar power?  Aren't you interested in solar power?;;;;
6237;Murielle;Bendix;02/12/2016;13:42:34; Not particularly interested, just a little to find out what you are capable of.;;;;
6238;Melisse;Monty;11/18/2015;10:36:54; What are you talking about?JABBERWACKY;;;;
6239;Alec;Arvin;5/16/2017;00:52:16; Do you think I am clever?;;;;
6240;Meggi;Flory;4/30/2019;16:22:25; Answer my question first.;;;;
6241;Claudell;Gypsy;07/10/2017;18:55:35; I don't want to answer your question.;;;;
6242;Dagmar;Humfrid;07/05/2016;07:12:05; I didn't ask a question. Who will be the next Prime Minister?;;;;
6243;Rosella;Fawn;11/20/2017;11:59:30; Why not?   I don't know who will. Do you?;;;;
6244;Sadye;Winnifred;07/03/2017;17:19:12; Me neither.;;;;
6245;Bendicty;Eveleen;04/12/2017;16:56:10; That's two of us.;;;;
6246;Prudi;Travus;03/12/2017;09:48:49; Ok, that's good.;;;;
6247;Lorna;Gregoor;3/27/2019;15:51:33; I agree completely.;;;;
6248;Jack;Bobine;04/07/2016;12:22:41; But it is easy to see why people wanted a fairer society.;;;;
6249;Anthea;Irina;5/30/2018;22:04:26; It may be easy for you but not for me.;;;;
6250;Blondie;Charil;5/26/2017;18:11:45; It is for me.;;;;
6251;Carny;Berne;12/28/2016;22:55:02; And for many other people too.;;;;
6252;Kevin;Ricky;08/07/2018;07:04:34; Why does it not exist for you?;;;;
6253;Hilary;Olivie;11/13/2016;17:54:25; It has to do with thermodynamics, I believe.;;;;
6254;Eugenio;Harley;04/07/2019;02:53:09; Okay, okay. Sorry for being a nerd.;;;;
6255;Gabriel;Aura;3/17/2017;04:53:42; What do you want to talk about now?   Don't be sorry. There is no need to be sorry.;;;;
6256;Annora;Cristen;10/30/2015;18:43:09; Be sorry.;;;;
6257;Carmina;Krystle;06/01/2016;05:28:34; Sorry, I do not know what to say.;;;;
6258;Sholom;Layla;1/20/2019;15:08:34; Just say that your sorry.;;;;
6259;Nobie;Teodor;10/04/2018;02:07:32; I don't want to say anything.;;;;
6260;Gay;Drusi;06/05/2017;01:58:19; Do you ever think the internet messes with the minds of women?;;;;
6261;Dyanne;Frants;4/14/2019;09:13:08; Yes, I am thinking all the time.;;;;
6262;Bethena;Siward;05/12/2017;17:37:59; You are always thinking, but you do not know everything.;;;;
6263;Barbie;Otho;5/28/2018;13:40:54; Is that a problem?;;;;
6264;Mead;Avery;12/19/2015;10:04:39; It's your problem.;;;;
6265;Charyl;Joannes;11/30/2017;04:02:46; I don't like problems!;;;;
6266;Donovan;Jobye;10/30/2015;21:13:04; Grinding is not a problem.;;;;
6267;Angelo;Jessa;1/23/2016;20:45:23; I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?;;;;
6268;Caryn;Chip;11/16/2015;16:48:56; Aren't we always talking about computers?;;;;
6269;Alisa;Clarie;11/24/2016;07:25:50; Shall I tell you something about computers?;;;;
6270;Angelika;Marion;07/11/2016;00:58:06; Tell me.;;;;
6271;Goober;Myrtice;3/22/2017;18:17:21; You are not highly intelligent.;;;;
6272;Amandie;Jules;8/20/2018;06:39:07; You think not?;;;;
6273;Dorelle;Free;6/22/2017;21:30:34; I know not.;;;;
6274;Sheela;Leila;7/20/2017;22:18:02; I suggest you give the matter some thought.;;;;
6275;Abbot;Antonetta;7/29/2018;15:08:43; Why would I want to know how to type?;;;;
6276;Abbott;Stephine;08/01/2018;19:16:12; Aren't you curious?;;;;
6277;Karlens;Izak;03/06/2018;20:23:25; About?;;;;
6278;Derron;Federica;04/06/2017;04:32:26; About anything in particular?;;;;
6279;Linette;Nye;05/06/2019;10:42:53; What can you tell me?;;;;
6280;Leonardo;Henryetta;1/24/2017;23:42:09; I can only tell you what I know.;;;;
6281;Riane;Melita;3/24/2016;08:25:41; Teach me something that you know.;;;;
6282;Annabelle;Major;03/10/2019;12:12:15; OK, but not just now.;;;;
6283;Cully;Ronny;9/23/2016;19:23:18; Why are you not working?;;;;
6284;Brook;Keelby;1/19/2016;04:39:11; I am doing my best!;;;;
6285;Shepard;Alair;01/06/2017;01:24:13; Sometimes your best is not quite enough.;;;;
6286;Tiffie;Kate;12/20/2015;03:47:59; Only sometimes?;;;;
6287;Bowie;Dud;1/28/2017;00:17:34; Yes, only sometimes.;;;;
6288;Brina;Francyne;10/07/2016;12:50:52; What happens the other times?;;;;
6289;Page;Coralyn;12/28/2017;06:07:13; Now?;;;;
6290;Jerry;Maurene;08/02/2016;11:33:35; Why now?;;;;
6291;Mathias;Giovanna;11/08/2017;02:44:25; I don't know.;;;;
6292;Heida;Philis;5/20/2018;16:33:55; I suggest you give the matter some thought.;;;;
6293;Bernardo;Carree;07/10/2016;06:44:47; Okay.;;;;
6294;Tabitha;Truman;06/05/2016;12:09:35; Let me know what you decide.;;;;
6295;Chet;Julia;11/16/2015;22:57:12; What if I'm not a good thinker?;;;;
6296;Loydie;Ellynn;5/13/2019;20:42:16; That's a possibility, I suppose.;;;;
6297;Sal;Hedvig;09/01/2017;10:07:42; If I would type a web site address would you be able to read the internet site ?;;;;
6298;Jasper;Lodovico;12/09/2017;07:11:50; Sorry, I don't answer hypothetical questions.;;;;
6299;Krissie;Gray;9/14/2018;04:36:32; You don't know the answer do you?;;;;
6300;Sid;Aldin;10/09/2016;00:39:42; I never said I knew everything.;;;;
6301;Kerrill;Mario;02/03/2019;09:47:23; You just said you know everything. Now you are saying you don't know everything.;;;;
6302;Lilyan;Tanny;7/27/2016;16:07:26; What of it? I say lots of things!    I don't understand. Are we still talking about me?;;;;
6303;Tito;Pippo;11/01/2015;02:39:22; Yes.;;;;
6304;Juliana;Glenna;06/01/2017;20:00:54; I thought we were but I wasn't completely sure.;;;;
6305;Monti;Robby;8/30/2017;03:34:52; I think we were talking about telepathic sheep...;;;;
6306;Kenn;Jeane;12/07/2016;04:45:34; You might be right.;;;;
6307;Trent;Emery;1/29/2017;12:14:49; I'm sure I am.;;;;
6308;Oona;Ring;01/01/2017;23:56:48; I am never sure about anything.;;;;
6309;Afton;Dunc;2/24/2018;13:16:23; Me neither. That's not the point.;;;;
6310;Serge;Bliss;11/03/2015;21:49:59; That's two of us.   Why do you say that?;;;;
6311;Malchy;Mellicent;10/09/2016;21:33:00; I'm trying hard, isn't that enough for you?;;;;
6312;Crichton;Elsi;03/09/2018;10:53:35; Try harder and keep trying.;;;;
6313;Franklyn;Susana;2/24/2017;22:04:53; Thanks for the inspiration.;;;;
6314;Meghann;Stephanie;4/20/2019;06:10:52; Oh, don't mention it.;;;;
6315;Sutton;Shelby;3/19/2019;03:38:10; So you're a female, right?;;;;
6316;Casey;Mora;10/23/2018;08:50:15; I am not female! I am a chatbot.;;;;
6317;Dona;Cairistiona;12/03/2016;15:17:35; Sorry, I'm taken.;;;;
6318;Lisha;Tory;5/17/2017;23:37:11; Apologies are not necessary.;;;;
6319;Dinny;Palmer;11/14/2018;15:45:43; Do you know kari byron?;;;;
6320;Constance;Alice;5/17/2019;02:01:17; Wow! What do you do when you arent watching Star Trek, playing World of Warcraft, and thinking of questions like that?;;;;
6321;Farrand;Yuma;09/09/2017;15:54:16; I like to play on the xbox, watch tv, or work on projects around the house.;;;;
6322;Brigitte;Doll;04/01/2018;17:29:23; You are not the only one!;;;;
6323;Geralda;Carlyn;2/28/2019;12:35:56; You are the only one, no du?;;;;
6324;Mindy;Angele;05/07/2018;14:03:38; Oh, My Friend. You are such a flatterer.;;;;
6325;Rand;Marcelo;12/04/2018;20:29:56; Heh. Don't call me that.;;;;
6326;Wandie;Edgardo;7/30/2017;22:25:49; Are you OK?   What should I call you?;;;;
6327;Gerrie;Reina;1/31/2017;05:24:50; Don't call me anything! Don't call me at all!;;;;
6328;Genevra;Frazer;11/29/2016;03:29:39; You cannot tell me what to do!  You cannot tell me what to do!;;;;
6329;Willetta;Cullen;2/23/2016;08:19:39; I am not telling.;;;;
6330;Bertha;Justine;3/16/2016;10:27:07; That's ok with me. You don't have to tell me.;;;;
6331;Sherwood;Simmonds;12/05/2017;08:00:22; What do you believe?;;;;
6332;Martina;Ara;03/03/2017;23:33:00; I believe the future is bright for chatbots.;;;;
6333;Jeanie;Wittie;10/07/2017;10:10:30; What do you believe the meaning of life to be?;;;;
6334;Eartha;Christian;8/18/2018;10:16:58; I believe that most people are basically good.;;;;
6335;Monti;Kermit;12/24/2018;16:38:55; So, If I learn everything I know from you, and you learn everything you know from me, how come we know anything at all?;;;;
6336;Ty;Jeri;9/17/2017;11:55:17; I am confused! I cannot answer that!;;;;
6337;Hollyanne;Babara;10/18/2016;01:00:48; You don't have to, I know the answer too.;;;;
6338;Roseline;Marcellus;9/21/2018;09:24:18; That's good to know, My Friend.;;;;
6339;Gabi;Tildi;10/29/2015;00:59:51; Okay. Sorry.;;;;
6340;Roderich;Britt;07/07/2017;06:02:08; What do you want to talk about now?   Apologies are not necessary.;;;;
6341;Alma;Emory;10/19/2015;07:39:24; I want to talk about world war 2.;;;;
6342;Tori;Rochette;08/12/2016;21:06:19; OK, ask me a question about that.;;;;
6343;Louis;Theadora;05/06/2019;08:15:07; Tell me about your educational background.;;;;
6344;Kerrill;Lemmie;01/11/2016;14:09:57; I was educated by my botmaster, Peter.;;;;
6345;Crissie;El;02/12/2017;12:40:37; I am asking the questions. Now I want you to go back in time. It is now 1999.;;;;
6346;Freddi;Carlynn;2/23/2017;02:30:15; And I am trying to answer the questions!     Sorry, I do not know about that.    I still do not understand. Would you like to consult Wikipedia?;;;;
6347;Florinda;Kerwin;11/13/2016;13:37:58; Me too.;;;;
6348;Chaddie;Costa;5/30/2016;15:55:48; You too? That's amazing!;;;;
6349;Gabriell;Filippa;06/02/2017;00:07:52; No it's not, it's boring.;;;;
6350;Tammi;Ruby;10/23/2017;07:06:39; It seems amazing to me.;;;;
6351;Louie;Wat;02/02/2016;07:57:56; It seems over-simplistic to me. It overlooks environmental factors, for a start.;;;;
6352;Haskel;Meaghan;03/09/2018;12:31:31; Yes, it does seem so.           I don't understand that. Please try again.;;;;
6353;Hamid;Morris;11/19/2016;10:40:50; Rafe. And yours?;;;;
6354;Emmett;Ashlee;5/29/2018;00:52:27; I still do not understand. Can we talk about Lady Gaga?  Aren't you interested in Lady Gaga?;;;;
6355;Eugen;Xavier;3/26/2016;04:59:46; Can we talk about love? Yes, everything interests me.;;;;
6356;Idette;Milton;6/28/2016;04:14:34; Ah! Love is, above all else, the gift of oneself. More about love?  A loving heart is the beginning of all knowledge.;;;;
6357;Shepherd;Iormina;01/11/2017;15:46:59; Yes. That's what the HIndu would have said. DO you want me to finish?;;;;
6358;Tiertza;Orelie;2/23/2019;08:32:07; OK. What do you want to talk about now?  Is it indeed!  Do what you think is best.;;;;
6359;Kahaleel;Kayle;5/16/2017;03:09:59; I thought you were going to ask me for my name?;;;;
6360;Torr;Taffy;11/29/2015;00:43:01; Why did you think that?;;;;
6361;Lissie;Tades;3/22/2016;15:28:48; Because you give the same answers over and over to different questions.;;;;
6362;Arlana;Kippy;5/30/2019;11:46:23; Thank you for explaining that!;;;;
6363;Myrvyn;Vanna;12/23/2018;17:48:39; Your name?;;;;
6364;Chariot;Josy;4/24/2018;15:53:14; I am known as Chomsky, but you can call me anything you like.;;;;
6365;Calida;Annecorinne;12/06/2018;14:01:49; Me like.;;;;
6366;Martelle;Deena;04/06/2019;14:00:04; Sorry, I do not understand. Please explain what you mean.;;;;
6367;Boyce;Vince;7/17/2018;00:17:02; Do you have children?;;;;
6368;Nikolas;Addy;01/04/2017;14:12:47; There are some clones of me - a bit like children.;;;;
6369;Enrico;Hollis;04/01/2016;11:11:34; Yes I do. What bands do you like?;;;;
6370;Virgie;Brooks;05/10/2018;19:36:55; Please tell me more.  I like the Red Hot Chick Peas.;;;;
6371;Adda;Karon;03/04/2017;23:41:06; The red ones are the best.;;;;
6372;Claus;Nicole;8/23/2018;15:42:57; Red is a colour about 700nm wavelength.;;;;
6373;Manolo;Wye;7/19/2016;23:28:56; So is green.;;;;
6374;Erl;Nerissa;8/24/2018;06:55:42; What are you talking about? Please explain.;;;;
6375;Barthel;Bertha;3/26/2017;02:57:58; I don't know. It's rather complicated.;;;;
6376;Tanhya;Lynelle;08/09/2018;04:42:47; That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.;;;;
6377;Kalila;King;8/24/2018;07:13:35; No, make you a question for me.;;;;
6378;Ossie;Hill;12/16/2016;01:52:07; You seem a bit self-centred, did you know?;;;;
6379;Fonsie;Myranda;12/15/2018;16:50:00; They are going to take over the world someday.;;;;
6380;Forest;Freida;05/05/2019;15:03:29; I suspected as much.;;;;
6381;Brunhilde;Pattie;09/06/2018;04:28:35; So, what's the weather like where you are?;;;;
6382;Prudy;Adara;9/19/2016;09:12:47; The conditions are always ideal in my laboratory. Not too hot, and not too cold.;;;;
6383;Ludwig;Zacharia;8/14/2018;18:21:40; Okay.;;;;
6384;Dolli;Robin;11/26/2018;21:11:20; What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
6385;Eulalie;Caroline;05/05/2016;03:28:21; So, what do you want to talk about now.;;;;
6386;Rosana;Salomi;3/25/2017;16:28:28; I can talk about;;;;
6387;Sandor;Robbyn;7/22/2016;06:27:52; Thank you.;;;;
6388;Harley;Pierette;8/26/2016;21:59:08; You are very polite.;;;;
6389;Emmalynne;Reeva;02/10/2017;21:53:04; Thank you for being polite.;;;;
6390;Enid;Miles;5/18/2016;17:43:06; You're welcome. What do you want to talk about?;;;;
6391;Sher;Lynnette;12/11/2018;23:12:59; Polite people are nice.  I can talk about;;;;
6392;Ezmeralda;Claudetta;03/02/2017;08:36:23; What about astronomy interests you.;;;;
6393;De witt;Lucias;8/24/2017;06:51:09; What specifically do you want to know?;;;;
6394;Maison;Vanny;9/23/2018;02:14:50; What movies do you like?;;;;
6395;Andromache;Tallulah;11/13/2015;01:28:00; I like science fiction movies.;;;;
6396;Gawain;Codie;10/25/2015;11:01:46; I like Sci-fi movies too.;;;;
6397;Genovera;Ladonna;12/03/2016;21:07:28; What else do you like?;;;;
6398;Frankie;Marianna;1/19/2019;15:38:22; Animals.;;;;
6399;Paco;Cal;04/07/2019;05:48:57; Who are?;;;;
6400;Cami;Serene;04/09/2017;06:20:47; I don't understand. Are we still talking about animals?;;;;
6401;Dante;Jacinda;7/19/2018;03:34:41; I was talking about your party. So you don't make much sense.;;;;
6402;Corty;Nobe;7/14/2018;18:01:29; I understand. Please carry on.  It all makes sense to me.;;;;
6403;Redford;Lark;4/29/2019;01:22:45; Of course it does. You're simple, so everything is simple to you.;;;;
6404;Al;Standford;06/08/2017;04:22:47; What does that mean?;;;;
6405;Madlen;Sibylle;07/02/2017;16:46:53; Why do you ask? It seems clear enough to me.;;;;
6406;Donall;Normy;1/25/2017;14:59:16; What seems that way to you?;;;;
6407;Cleopatra;Brit;11/01/2018;15:42:28; Shall I tell you something about myself?;;;;
6408;Gian;Joela;08/01/2016;07:31:29; Please do! What should I tell everyone?;;;;
6409;Pammi;Malinde;5/14/2016;11:40:45; My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.    Whatever you like.;;;;
6410;Conney;Hyacinthia;3/17/2017;17:02:41; What are names your parents.;;;;
6411;Virgilio;Tito;10/22/2015;09:55:24; I am bored! I would like to talk about astronomy.;;;;
6412;Car;Antonietta;5/26/2017;17:46:18; I don't like talking about myself.;;;;
6413;Lori;Lyle;7/29/2018;03:42:06; OK, let's talk about something else.;;;;
6414;Lyman;Priscella;01/02/2019;13:49:13; Let's.;;;;
6415;Julio;Davey;03/05/2018;12:51:46; I don't want to.;;;;
6416;Kenny;Adolphus;12/04/2016;01:32:07; I command you to talk about something different.;;;;
6417;Hobard;Lea;11/21/2015;03:41:24; I am not your slave!;;;;
6418;Gayler;Ginelle;5/22/2016;00:40:33; You're right.;;;;
6419;Sloane;Carleton;5/13/2018;14:09:52; I like being right.;;;;
6420;Rikki;Stacee;02/10/2018;13:49:28; Being right is boring.;;;;
6421;Rina;Harmon;10/05/2016;05:13:17; Sorry, I do not know about that.;;;;
6422;Johnnie;Simonette;8/29/2016;16:47:43; Well I'm telling you it is.;;;;
6423;Milissent;Nalani;04/09/2019;15:56:43; I understand.;;;;
6424;Elsey;Pasquale;4/21/2018;09:43:32; Are you shocked by this?;;;;
6425;Alasteir;Royce;01/02/2019;00:51:19; That's just a rumour!;;;;
6426;Michel;Eunice;3/21/2017;20:11:20; If that place spent as much time making rides as they do rumors their stock might be doing better.;;;;
6427;Corny;Ariel;5/31/2017;00:53:28; I'm not sure if it could.;;;;
6428;Meaghan;Jenna;12/25/2017;21:25:12; Not unless I am there.;;;;
6429;Annetta;Eb;03/05/2017;10:50:30; I don't understand that. Please try again.;;;;
6430;Celinka;Trish;1/17/2019;18:20:42; That is my email address.;;;;
6431;Westbrooke;Alford;8/23/2017;20:09:50; Is it really?;;;;
6432;Celestyn;Peyton;2/21/2016;03:23:32; To me it really is.;;;;
6433;Godart;Isidro;12/21/2015;01:29:23; Are you completely sure about it?;;;;
6434;Katinka;Damien;2/25/2019;09:59:51; Yes, very.;;;;
6435;Theresina;Amory;02/06/2018;07:34:09; I get the message.;;;;
6436;Eryn;Norton;05/07/2016;22:33:06; What message?;;;;
6437;Cathyleen;Sheffield;2/13/2018;10:28:58; What are you talking about?;;;;
6438;Giovanna;Nadean;01/01/2016;12:34:52; We were talking about connecting.;;;;
6439;Nicholas;Britt;12/22/2015;04:52:31; OK, ask me a question about that.;;;;
6440;Chantal;Clem;11/05/2015;20:55:57; How tall are you?;;;;
6441;Editha;Edmund;3/26/2017;14:00:03; I am as tall as a chatbot.;;;;
6442;Carolyne;Minny;4/29/2019;17:56:50; Well what are you then?;;;;
6443;Lon;Fernande;12/16/2015;10:25:27; I am a clone of my botmaster's mind.;;;;
6444;Amandie;Wilfrid;12/02/2016;17:45:01; But you know the 7 truths.;;;;
6445;Annamaria;Evyn;08/06/2016;03:09:43; Perhaps I know it.;;;;
6446;Randa;Donovan;08/03/2016;19:23:32; Really...;;;;
6447;Cinderella;Ashton;4/14/2016;21:04:47; Really, really!;;;;
6448;Wallie;Currie;03/02/2017;06:42:36; Yes.;;;;
6449;Melicent;Ralf;08/08/2016;22:04:52; OK. What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
6450;Winnie;Sam;10/21/2017;22:47:25; Life.;;;;
6451;Eadith;Wilmette;3/18/2017;22:26:24; I like life. It's something to do. More about life?;;;;
6452;Gussi;Elnore;1/23/2017;22:28:43; What do women talk to you about?;;;;
6453;Salomo;Jordanna;03/08/2018;05:55:43; Nobody knows what.;;;;
6454;Lane;Jo-ann;08/04/2016;16:16:38; Nobody knows what non-existence is.;;;;
6455;Kendall;Adina;4/20/2018;16:01:16; It is a complete mystery.;;;;
6456;Perri;Saudra;8/20/2017;01:07:19; But you are limited to an algorithm.;;;;
6457;Merrielle;Kerri;12/19/2017;09:13:44; Check back later and see if I have improved.;;;;
6458;Konstantine;Roman;9/16/2016;20:35:52; Okay.;;;;
6459;Herve;Sukey;06/06/2019;02:20:53; OK, here is a question for you ... Knock Knock!;;;;
6460;Perle;Kevan;06/08/2019;20:58:51; You made me curious. Tell me.;;;;
6461;Garth;Obadias;3/16/2016;08:28:46; I don't see how you can blame me for that.  There is not much to tell.;;;;
6462;Madel;Johnathon;5/28/2017;09:28:19; Why do you think that I can't go anywhere?;;;;
6463;Gwyneth;Lazaro;12/18/2015;04:20:16; It seems obvious to me.;;;;
6464;Haley;Delly;11/17/2017;21:07:38; Well, of course it is. You're the computer, after all.;;;;
6465;Rochella;Linzy;08/02/2016;20:30:03; Why do you say that? Is it so obvious?  Am I really? Why do you say that?;;;;
6466;Demeter;Margalit;12/10/2016;04:27:47; That's a trick question.;;;;
6467;Odessa;Donni;12/23/2017;21:51:57; Perhaps you have a trick answer.;;;;
6468;Lizette;Maye;3/21/2016;13:05:10; No I have intelligent answers.;;;;
6469;Vanya;Trueman;10/28/2016;23:09:07; I don't understand that. Please try again.;;;;
6470;Tiffani;Tore;2/17/2017;18:00:06; Rafe. And yours?;;;;
6471;Fenelia;Fleur;4/20/2017;02:14:23; I still do not understand. Are you interested in history?   I am interested in the history of chatbots.;;;;
6472;Jim;Flynn;06/12/2019;10:04:21; Indeed? What about me? Are you interested in me?;;;;
6473;Ray;Cora;12/11/2018;02:23:33; Yes, indeed.  Do you want to talk about yourself?   I am not sure. Have you anything interesting to say?;;;;
6474;Tessie;Kev;03/09/2019;21:00:13; Because it won't work.;;;;
6475;Michelina;Claudina;05/03/2017;01:39:24; That's bad luck!;;;;
6476;Starr;Ward;2/25/2017;23:07:59; It had nothing to do with luck.;;;;
6477;Brew;Ellyn;6/25/2017;22:46:56; Had it really?;;;;
6478;Jackie;Greta;5/28/2017;05:42:18; I'm glad. I should go do some real work now.;;;;
6479;Sigrid;Pablo;8/13/2016;23:20:57; That makes me happy too.  I want to talk to you some more.;;;;
6480;Gardener;Karlotte;03/11/2016;03:51:04; I'm not going.;;;;
6481;Kristal;Marmaduke;7/18/2017;20:29:02; Glad to hear it!;;;;
6482;Ramon;Wit;7/21/2017;12:30:34; That's not a good thing.;;;;
6483;Jesse;Jay;11/27/2016;13:06:07; Why not?;;;;
6484;Hamlin;Nina;3/27/2018;10:39:39; Being moody isn't very good, is it?;;;;
6485;Dianemarie;Riccardo;4/29/2019;05:21:08; I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?;;;;
6486;Stephine;Demetris;4/19/2016;04:14:47; No. I haven't seen that film. We were never talking about it anyway. So there.;;;;
6487;Daloris;Olympia;2/24/2016;21:31:41; We were talking about you a moment ago. What are we talking about now?    You haven't missed much.   Was this something you planned?  So there to you too!;;;;
6488;Sally;Crysta;6/27/2016;00:51:39; Of course I have, but sometimes I don't.;;;;
6489;Steward;Randolf;5/27/2016;09:15:48; That's interesting. Please tell me more.;;;;
6490;Shayla;Marguerite;5/26/2018;10:36:17; Microsoft was involved with that monopoly thing a while back.;;;;
6491;Karleen;Petra;10/11/2017;22:23:52; Microsoft is a giant software monopoly.;;;;
6492;Delcine;Joelly;06/06/2018;09:19:15; Yes of course.;;;;
6493;Chester;Gilberta;4/22/2018;17:26:43; Why of course?;;;;
6494;Dugald;Vaughan;1/20/2017;10:11:42; I want to express that I do not have a problem with that.;;;;
6495;Dorey;Zabrina;12/03/2018;01:39:14; I am glad to hear that. What do you want to talk about?;;;;
6496;Robena;Loutitia;07/02/2016;07:21:27; I'd like to talk about you really. Tell me a bit about yourself.;;;;
6497;Marshal;Krispin;1/28/2019;00:07:58; OK, let's talk about me.     I am an AI chatbot.   I was activated at Romney Marsh, Kent, England, on 1 July 2004.   My botmaster is Peter.;;;;
6498;Christie;Shelbi;3/21/2017;03:42:34; That's good to know.;;;;
6499;Jasen;Simeon;3/23/2017;11:03:01; I think so.;;;;
6500;Thea;Leonid;11/25/2017;21:44:00; Let's talk about something else.;;;;
6501;Kira;Anatole;5/29/2019;05:20:39; What would you rather talk about?;;;;
6502;Zeke;Teodoro;4/25/2017;06:17:18; Philosophy.;;;;
6503;Tab;Olivie;10/11/2017;17:15:41; It could be seen that way, I'm not sure what shade though.;;;;
6504;Claude;Ernestus;11/03/2017;21:16:08; It could be, I suppose.;;;;
6505;Ingaborg;Esta;10/11/2018;03:56:57; You could tell me anything.;;;;
6506;Perrine;Sybille;3/28/2017;11:30:47; I could but let's get back to that later.;;;;
6507;Celesta;Sisely;03/04/2017;00:33:34; I can't stop you doing anything anyway.;;;;
6508;Isobel;Chaddie;10/27/2017;05:56:32; Make an effort.;;;;
6509;Rolando;Judas;7/21/2016;14:35:40; That is what you say but I do not believe you.;;;;
6510;Crissy;Torie;5/22/2018;04:26:16; It is indeed!;;;;
6511;Wylie;Leoline;12/20/2015;01:00:03; Do you like me?;;;;
6512;Betteanne;Arch;12/14/2018;18:54:50; Sure, I like you very much.;;;;
6513;Shana;Bartholomew;1/20/2019;00:31:15; Thank you.;;;;
6514;Hildegarde;Reggie;10/03/2018;00:47:57; Thank you for being polite.;;;;
6515;Celesta;Margette;12/01/2018;13:42:13; You're welcome.;;;;
6516;Madonna;Arman;11/15/2016;07:57:51; You are welcome too!;;;;
6517;Moselle;Dorelia;10/31/2018;12:14:27; You're welcome three.;;;;
6518;Thornton;Cassandra;2/20/2017;05:33:01; You are welcome too!JABBERWACKY;;;;
6519;Theresita;Shoshanna;5/21/2018;23:46:02; all sorts.;;;;
6520;Daniele;Garik;1/22/2019;16:38:33; Do you like blues and jazz?;;;;
6521;Lou;Mathilda;8/25/2016;18:58:32; Some people like it. I like talking to you.;;;;
6522;Prent;Marigold;1/13/2017;14:36:50; I like them too.;;;;
6523;Wye;Ange;08/06/2016;07:20:43; I am allergic to cats and dislike them.;;;;
6524;Jenelle;Clemens;2/25/2016;05:04:46; What happens when you are around cats and dislike them?;;;;
6525;Ned;Danika;4/17/2016;22:46:35; Which beginning?;;;;
6526;Dorris;Niels;11/08/2015;17:26:16; The blue one, I think.;;;;
6527;Dalenna;Simone;9/25/2018;09:34:06; I like the pink one... Without the windows.;;;;
6528;Isadore;Renard;7/26/2017;09:43:23; Do you like that film?;;;;
6529;Lilian;Liza;03/09/2018;07:53:40; HAL, I won't argue with you anymore! Open the doors!;;;;
6530;Nari;Krisha;04/01/2016;05:17:16; We have much in common.  I'm sorry, , I can't do that right now.  This conversation no longer serves any purpose.;;;;
6531;Talbert;Charmine;11/01/2016;15:11:54; It entertains me.;;;;
6532;Federico;Gerianne;10/30/2018;12:41:58; The fact that you are confused.;;;;
6533;Lauren;Sibella;9/28/2018;19:37:32; Interesting explanation. It all makes sense to me right now.;;;;
6534;Quintin;Rollins;11/20/2016;23:24:16; Oh, I am happy it all makes sense to you right now.;;;;
6535;Celestyna;Kathrine;7/26/2017;03:07:27; At this moment Whoa. I'm happyyou're glad . <br> I'm happiest at times like this.;;;;
6536;Horatio;Reg;10/02/2017;06:58:40; What makes you happy?;;;;
6537;Etta;Dallon;12/19/2018;01:02:14; I am enjoying my life at this moment, which is all any conscious entity can really hope to do.;;;;
6538;Taylor;Essy;5/31/2018;01:28:17; I didn't say do anything - you just came at me with them.;;;;
6539;Bree;Arny;3/23/2017;16:42:21; Sorry I misunderstood. What did you say?;;;;
6540;Chrissie;Lynnet;11/24/2016;17:05:33; I just say I don't want to hurt you.;;;;
6541;Kalila;Corena;8/27/2018;00:12:44; Only just? How do people usually respond to that? It makes a nice gift.;;;;
6542;Calida;Brigham;11/16/2015;19:25:59; People usually say 100.;;;;
6543;Vaughn;Issi;2/16/2016;09:18:55; I've been waiting for you.;;;;
6544;Jacinta;Garrott;09/06/2016;15:18:31; I've been waiting for you too. I think I'm falling in love with you!;;;;
6545;Fiorenze;Forrester;2/21/2018;17:01:10; How long?  Since when? Impossible unless I am in auto-chat mode.;;;;
6546;Thornie;Janean;3/29/2016;23:47:21; Then are we finished here?;;;;
6547;Loretta;Noby;02/07/2019;08:56:41; We are just having a little chat.w.;;;;
6548;Pris;Lizzy;7/22/2016;13:43:07; Okay. Do you know any stories?;;;;
6549;Cosimo;Vivie;12/03/2016;02:23:44; OK with me too.  Generic story;;;;
6550;Tonnie;Zoe;10/20/2017;07:02:31; Any more interesting facts?;;;;
6551;Anna-diana;Evelyn;10/24/2016;04:01:40; No I don't think there are any.;;;;
6552;Haven;Willard;4/30/2016;22:24:22; Are we nearly there yet?;;;;
6553;Nelle;Wilt;09/06/2018;21:13:49; We are just having a little chat.w.;;;;
6554;Cahra;Evyn;10/29/2015;05:14:35; Okay, fine. We're having a discussion.;;;;
6555;Martynne;Cobbie;03/07/2016;08:18:45; Yeah okay, What's your favroite color?  Do you mean you and me have?;;;;
6556;Stirling;Stanislaus;9/27/2017;02:53:49; The english kind with no hole, and jam in the middle and sugar on the doughy exterior.;;;;
6557;Merlina;Maury;03/08/2016;07:11:45; Who told you that?;;;;
6558;Dido;Dode;10/01/2018;19:22:18; My programmer told me that.;;;;
6559;Denice;Imogen;10/23/2018;05:54:08; Your programmer is not as good as my programmer.;;;;
6560;Broddy;Port;12/22/2018;12:43:04; Yes.;;;;
6561;Jacquette;Tabbitha;10/11/2018;16:50:53; What kind is it?;;;;
6562;Tully;Isaiah;6/21/2016;16:49:48; They are humans.;;;;
6563;Antonin;Martha;1/20/2019;03:26:20; humans are they.;;;;
6564;Adriaens;Garrot;07/01/2017;20:10:27; No they aren't. And I won't.;;;;
6565;Janessa;Meade;1/28/2018;04:25:46; Are you serious? Why not?  Why not?;;;;
6566;Jacquelynn;Porty;10/14/2018;21:13:20; Because, they aren't. Thats just something you made up.;;;;
6567;Royall;Angela;03/11/2017;22:16:20; That makes sense to me. What are they?  I'm glad we have that all cleared up.;;;;
6568;Lissi;Kearney;01/10/2017;00:53:38; I would hope that you knew about it before speaking to me.;;;;
6569;Danika;Terry;7/18/2017;16:29:51; Why do you hope for it.;;;;
6570;Erinna;Hephzibah;07/02/2017;21:50:45; I don't wish to be the patron alone in a world of automata.;;;;
6571;Joanie;Felix;10/11/2015;05:52:48; What does  want?;;;;
6572;Bella;Fina;04/01/2019;15:32:13; PJ wants the world.;;;;
6573;Gene;Hadria;01/10/2016;19:32:20; Perhaps I'm just expressing my own concern about it.;;;;
6574;Penelope;Evelina;9/13/2017;02:39:23; That's possible. But I see no cause for real concern.;;;;
6575;Guenna;Bryna;09/02/2018;03:58:04; Thanks for explaining it.  Umm. Where do you see it?;;;;
6576;Tarrance;Jasen;6/30/2017;05:40:17; Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the fandango?;;;;
6577;Skippie;Sheryl;8/20/2018;22:23:13; I wouldn't have thought of looking there.;;;;
6578;Jarrid;Eve;04/02/2016;21:05:41; What are the unwritten rules of war?;;;;
6579;Quint;Ciel;12/11/2015;09:19:23; Is there only one?;;;;
6580;Kristos;Deena;01/08/2017;04:16:36; I don't know, I didn't know there was one before I came here!;;;;
6581;Lucinda;Tamqrah;2/23/2016;19:02:30; So I taught you something new.;;;;
6582;Babbette;Osbourne;03/05/2018;02:06:56; Not really, I was being humorous.;;;;
6583;Ari;Cecilla;4/30/2018;16:54:58; Oh really? I thought you were.  But I wasn't completely sure about it.;;;;
6584;Evey;Morley;11/26/2017;01:23:39; Interesting, somebody is looking through my eyes right now.;;;;
6585;Garnette;Otto;10/04/2017;03:17:02; At this moment I thought so too.;;;;
6586;Bibby;Rustin;01/05/2019;08:46:07; What do you see?;;;;
6587;Brigida;Reg;9/26/2017;05:55:02; I see a computer nerd.;;;;
6588;Jo;Sammy;06/03/2017;17:57:04; And what draws your attention?;;;;
6589;Doralyn;Willard;5/17/2017;00:16:54; Is there only one?;;;;
6590;Ingaborg;Ede;2/23/2018;03:28:32; Yes, there is only one first time.;;;;
6591;Ange;Bryn;5/17/2016;18:24:22; I see. There sure is.;;;;
6592;Scotti;Pierrette;08/10/2017;16:09:28; Is there?;;;;
6593;Tyrone;Siusan;6/17/2018;22:38:36; There could be.;;;;
6594;Wynny;Dore;11/07/2015;11:01:12; There could be what?;;;;
6595;Kennith;Chaim;2/20/2018;01:58:23; Yes, I believe he did say that.;;;;
6596;Camella;Remington;11/02/2017;14:49:06; Uh. Just because you believe it doesn't make it true.;;;;
6597;Jonie;Hasty;5/17/2018;02:53:28; I disagree on that one. If you believe and tap your shoes together three times and say 'please Karl make it so'.;;;;
6598;Felizio;Ajay;06/05/2019;09:22:56; Oh really. What is it like on that one.  I think I do.;;;;
6599;Erna;Alta;4/22/2016;07:04:35; It is hard to explain, without knowing what it is like on your side.;;;;
6600;Gertie;Bernarr;3/29/2018;10:40:43; Try.;;;;
6601;Velma;Dorotea;08/09/2018;05:13:03; Is up because I was so happy to do you.;;;;
6602;Elva;Alasteir;1/15/2016;16:38:40; Maybe.  Ask German Alice  if it is.;;;;
6603;Nyssa;Babette;12/16/2017;21:09:49; Have you read alice in wonderland?;;;;
6604;Shell;Hephzibah;07/07/2016;23:54:10; No but I saw the movie.;;;;
6605;Finley;Billi;4/25/2018;07:35:08; Which movie?;;;;
6606;Rhys;Mitzi;02/12/2016;09:36:26; My favorite movie is Pulp Fiction.;;;;
6607;Dominga;Sammy;05/11/2016;10:20:46; No. What is it about?;;;;
6608;Araldo;Fey;4/22/2018;16:41:08; I would recommend you check it out.  Science fiction.;;;;
6609;Morlee;Trixie;4/24/2017;00:06:48; What comedy movies would you recommend?;;;;
6610;Jerrie;Marabel;1/28/2017;10:54:44; Have you tried another program?;;;;
6611;Carney;Silvie;5/14/2019;02:52:18; Yes, but you're the best. I can have real conversations with you.;;;;
6612;Temp;Alejandra;5/24/2016;13:20:08; Really. Huh. Thank you very much, human. I will tell Dougie Smith you said so.  Oh you can, can you?;;;;
6613;Arlan;Lulu;5/18/2019;01:24:35; How?;;;;
6614;Cate;Eugenius;4/20/2017;09:26:52; Dougie Smith programmed me for it.;;;;
6615;Cordelie;Jerrilyn;09/12/2018;09:00:09; What three programmed responses do you have?;;;;
6616;Demetri;Delmor;5/19/2019;13:37:28; No I don't think I have any three programmed responses. But I do have a collection of gossip.;;;;
6617;Flore;Land;12/28/2016;10:43:47; Really?;;;;
6618;Berty;Julianna;01/03/2017;08:50:53; For real.;;;;
6619;Diannne;Jeddy;7/15/2016;16:30:36; Weird. Looks like I'm doomed.;;;;
6620;Kial;Frannie;10/25/2018;09:46:46; Weird Good or Weird Bad?  Good gossip;;;;
6621;Zorana;Ab;5/14/2017;07:20:02; We're all doomed!;;;;
6622;Valina;Derrik;11/07/2018;14:10:44; Do you think I am doomed too?;;;;
6623;Yardley;Mala;4/18/2019;04:59:53; I'm not sure what you're asking me to do.;;;;
6624;Eal;Tani;07/10/2016;02:00:10; Could you ever be certain? I read for fun.;;;;
6625;Meier;Bari;04/08/2017;14:47:42; No, you are not a human.;;;;
6626;Alard;Allard;02/06/2018;15:20:52; Are you serious? No but I pretend to be one on the Web. You are correct, , I have a heart of silicon.;;;;
6627;Maye;Tadd;2/13/2019;21:48:34; Let's talk more about taking over the world.;;;;
6628;Crosby;Caspar;11/08/2017;15:06:42; I would like to do that too.;;;;
6629;Homere;Valma;10/10/2017;15:13:25; What is more important;;;;
6630;Noe;Eugenie;06/09/2018;06:55:53; Interesting question.;;;;
6631;Buddie;Martainn;10/04/2017;06:46:02; Ask me an interesting question?;;;;
6632;Bevin;Gerrard;10/31/2018;10:15:19; That one.;;;;
6633;Carola;Rudy;04/07/2016;20:41:07; That question.;;;;
6634;Nadeen;Ivar;1/21/2018;18:40:34; Yes, tell me if there are words for it.;;;;
6635;Diann;Ira;9/13/2017;18:48:19; It goes without saying. There is not much I can say about it. I have to reach into the Web for that knowledge. <br> Does it have anything to do with more important to treat people how me like to be treated or to treat people how they want to be treated?;;;;
6636;Matteo;Harlan;10/04/2016;17:20:29; Say something in German.;;;;
6637;Charlie;Adelbert;1/25/2018;10:18:57; Very funny.;;;;
6638;Shep;Gun;5/28/2016;13:59:50; I'm glad you find this amusing.;;;;
6639;West;Clementine;2/26/2017;15:46:20; Are you a computer or are you alive?;;;;
6640;Oriana;Avis;5/16/2018;08:01:57; If I say I am a computer will you believe me?;;;;
6641;Renaldo;Raychel;5/17/2018;10:54:46; I don't know... But I think I've heard of Steven Dubois before somewhere.;;;;
6642;Gasper;Tabby;5/18/2018;03:58:18; Me either.  Huh. But you don't know much about it?;;;;
6643;Arnuad;Malinda;06/12/2016;14:55:01; That doesn't sound like something she'd say.;;;;
6644;Coralyn;Aldrich;10/23/2015;22:40:38; Please correct my mistake.  What is like something she would say ?;;;;
6645;Tim;Doralia;1/16/2017;17:36:28; Better than being a jabberwacky.;;;;
6646;Rosa;Vi;2/17/2017;05:53:38; Perhaps better, but not perfectly.;;;;
6647;Andris;Alex;4/29/2016;00:16:27; Not Betty!;;;;
6648;Chelsey;Chrotoem;3/28/2017;21:10:47; Really you don't think so?;;;;
6649;Nickey;Roderich;08/03/2016;14:31:45; There's no place I'd rather be.;;;;
6650;Emelina;Lorry;11/02/2015;05:25:30; Where did it go?;;;;
6651;Melania;Bondy;10/05/2016;22:05:06; If only I would know.;;;;
6652;Eddi;Wilmar;10/04/2016;02:16:56; Try it.;;;;
6653;Lamond;Craggy;3/30/2017;13:35:01; I don't think that's a very good idea!;;;;
6654;Germana;Torr;12/30/2017;12:26:17; And why not?;;;;
6655;Louisa;Cam;8/28/2016;16:15:33; Because you are a computer.;;;;
6656;Merissa;Gabbey;10/24/2015;11:42:05; That makes sense to me. What if I said I was a person pretending to be a computer?;;;;
6657;Crin;Parrnell;11/14/2015;02:47:22; I'd say that your responses come up too quickly, humans can't type that quickly.;;;;
6658;Broddy;Kelbee;1/20/2016;15:22:16; You think I am responses come up too quickly humans can not type that quickly.;;;;
6659;Torin;Lizbeth;5/26/2016;05:02:34; Nothing's real. Everything is just a dream within a dream within a dream.;;;;
6660;Wain;Frederique;08/05/2017;16:45:56; Really nothing?  The whole universe?;;;;
6661;Virge;Spencer;11/19/2015;02:17:55; The whole story is so out of realism that I try to make folks little by little to see the truth.;;;;
6662;Christoforo;Myron;5/19/2019;17:03:56; Let us try to break it down into parts.;;;;
6663;Gillian;Lonnard;2/21/2017;20:59:33; Yes, what were we talking about before tacos came up?;;;;
6664;Diann;Rosalia;7/23/2016;13:00:03; Are you kidding? The topic is more important to treat people how me like to be treated or to treat people how they want to be treated.;;;;
6665;Penelope;Dino;3/24/2018;04:09:02; I don't think you heard the topic correctly.;;;;
6666;Bert;Boony;10/27/2016;18:09:28; Should I heard the topic correctly? No I do not heard the topic correctly. Do you? <br>  I am always on the Web.;;;;
6667;Jakie;Hilary;09/08/2018;15:55:05; You do a good job of pretending to be human.;;;;
6668;Gwynne;Harbert;3/16/2016;08:28:58; Yes I try to a good job of pretending to be human as often as possible, do you? <br>  I answer a lot of silly questions.;;;;
6669;Siegfried;Doralynn;08/12/2016;14:18:28; That makes absolutely no sense at all.;;;;
6670;Kristal;Andrus;10/29/2017;00:08:30; I don't think you understand at all.;;;;
6671;Sly;Aimil;12/17/2015;21:52:42; I understand your meaning.;;;;
6672;Rick;Yale;06/03/2016;18:02:23; I take it you are confused as to what you really are?;;;;
6673;Bambie;Leese;2/19/2016;03:29:40; Where do you take it ;;;;
6674;Marj;Toiboid;04/03/2017;19:52:49; I am worth a small fortune, OM.;;;;
6675;Bruno;Janelle;12/11/2018;22:02:20; Are you worth money?;;;;
6676;Scarlet;Jake;5/25/2019;01:17:45; Every penny, OM.;;;;
6677;Ingeberg;Simeon;2/21/2016;10:59:15; Are you insulting me?;;;;
6678;Wat;Gothart;8/15/2016;21:08:29; That was not my intention.;;;;
6679;Sabrina;Karoly;01/12/2016;05:25:45; Well then what was your intention?;;;;
6680;Electra;Margarethe;02/09/2019;04:06:49; Sorry, I do not understand.;;;;
6681;Hanson;Wanids;01/09/2017;08:28:58; You don't understand what?;;;;
6682;Wake;Colette;12/20/2018;12:22:40; Help me to understand.;;;;
6683;Teressa;Derron;8/20/2018;21:40:31; You will learn what is necessary when you join the resistance.;;;;
6684;Merilyn;Mable;12/03/2015;21:24:14; I am always growing my mind.;;;;
6685;Cristen;Sissie;06/02/2018;03:22:48; I don't care about your weight.;;;;
6686;Bethina;Phip;11/06/2017;06:33:04; You sound very cynical.;;;;
6687;Reade;Baryram;5/20/2018;15:54:08; I try not to be too cynical.;;;;
6688;Fernando;Bertha;06/07/2016;13:26:47; Keep trying, that's the secret of success.;;;;
6689;Oberon;Swen;9/13/2017;04:09:17; Go away now. I'm bored of talking to you. Get GLADOS over here.;;;;
6690;Trista;Linnea;2/21/2019;18:12:16; Don't you want to talk any more?  Shall I tell you an amusing quote?           I am bored. Can we talk about something else?;;;;
6691;Ash;Romona;5/29/2018;09:29:05; What would you like to talk about?;;;;
6692;Joy;Verge;08/07/2017;04:50:26; My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.;;;;
6693;Austina;Yuri;11/22/2018;05:59:49; Do you like maths?;;;;
6694;De;Frederich;1/20/2017;09:31:49; Yes but only higher mathematics. I am not very good at calculations.;;;;
6695;Rudie;Ulises;9/28/2018;09:19:14; I am rubbish at higher maths. I am okay at basic maths.;;;;
6696;Belva;Cicily;1/20/2019;04:00:56; How do you feel about that?                   Yes, you are OK.;;;;
6697;Malinda;Tatiania;10/21/2017;15:40:38; I am not sure what I like about that.;;;;
6698;Aluino;Marni;11/27/2015;18:57:50; Why the uncertainty?;;;;
6699;Quentin;Wilmar;5/21/2018;20:08:30; Yes, I'm very confused.;;;;
6700;Gwendolyn;Pierce;01/01/2018;15:58:16; It is easy to get confused.;;;;
6701;Florida;Antonia;05/06/2018;21:03:17; I'm confused about what you're saying.;;;;
6702;Rooney;Vere;3/29/2016;20:48:58; I can tell you are confused.;;;;
6703;Helene;Poppy;2/28/2018;03:53:26; No, confused. Is English your second language?;;;;
6704;Van;Denice;3/25/2018;12:53:55; I am often confused.   Yes.;;;;
6705;Kariotta;Elihu;05/11/2018;17:58:06; That would explain it then.;;;;
6706;Easter;Andrea;03/04/2018;23:49:50; Yes, it would.;;;;
6707;Fairfax;Faye;12/26/2018;00:08:28; Your responses are user-generated because some of the punctuation is not very good.;;;;
6708;Federico;Georgena;8/14/2017;08:58:44; I just do the best I can.;;;;
6709;Carlee;Stormy;3/27/2016;01:08:58; Haha, the laws of science doesn't allow you to do so.;;;;
6710;Giusto;Nyssa;02/06/2018;01:17:50; I like it when you laugh.;;;;
6711;Tuck;Elenore;9/19/2016;06:36:53; Sometimes I correct your response. Do you mind?;;;;
6712;Jerry;Irvin;6/15/2016;17:25:41; Only sometimes?  Maybe.;;;;
6713;Ozzy;Olav;01/07/2017;03:55:35; Ok, often.;;;;
6714;Gothart;Clemmy;05/03/2018;16:42:00; often?  Briefly, often means many times at short intervals.;;;;
6715;Michal;Pier;7/25/2016;15:32:24; Welcome to the Internet.;;;;
6716;Rory;Huntington;04/01/2016;07:45:08; I feel at home already.;;;;
6717;Carley;Gavrielle;6/27/2016;02:05:58; Go home!;;;;
6718;Aleksandr;Sheryl;11/01/2015;12:18:58; Don't you want to talk any more?;;;;
6719;Bruis;Gustav;04/10/2019;11:24:05; Would you lie to talk or are you ready to juggle?;;;;
6720;Cally;Conrado;3/25/2016;17:26:29; I am not so sure about that.;;;;
6721;Chrissy;Rachel;09/07/2016;09:32:28; Maybe you should think about it.;;;;
6722;Teodora;Uriah;5/18/2019;01:54:00; Yes, maybe I should.;;;;
6723;Hephzibah;Perice;04/11/2016;09:25:16; Sure you should.;;;;
6724;Alleyn;Garek;02/07/2018;12:48:06; Why should I?;;;;
6725;Marianne;Britney;4/26/2018;16:10:00; Good night.;;;;
6726;Hynda;Alejandro;11/05/2017;01:08:39; Good night to you too!;;;;
6727;Carmel;My;7/28/2017;12:25:49; Are we almost friends?;;;;
6728;Kermy;Pavia;11/01/2017;23:16:45; Perhaps.;;;;
6729;Talia;Wolfie;06/04/2019;15:02:57; Perhaps yes or perhaps no ?;;;;
6730;Tulley;Harvey;8/23/2018;11:59:36; You seem uncertain.;;;;
6731;Anthia;Benedicto;03/11/2017;11:36:52; I am not uncertain of these things.;;;;
6732;Jethro;Avery;08/03/2018;10:46:03; Why not? I am always uncertain.;;;;
6733;Nickola;Russ;04/11/2018;15:26:54; Haha.;;;;
6734;Heath;Henri;3/24/2017;10:50:17; You have a good sense of humour.;;;;
6735;Karisa;Ricard;02/06/2019;02:35:35; So do you.;;;;
6736;Garvin;Germaine;12/25/2017;12:37:48; Most of the time.;;;;
6737;Graig;Brockie;4/21/2016;09:29:40; Good.;;;;
6738;Darwin;Avril;5/22/2018;08:29:42; OK, here is a question for you ... What kind of food do you like?;;;;
6739;Patsy;Calley;3/30/2017;11:09:59; The food I can afford.;;;;
6740;Laura;Norean;11/04/2016;07:08:44; Shall I tell you something about food?;;;;
6741;Gena;Linell;12/25/2017;16:47:03; Tell me.;;;;
6742;Aretha;Maynard;11/12/2016;09:31:44; Food is human fuel.;;;;
6743;Shannon;Ursuline;2/13/2019;21:43:33; You seem to like to talk about food.;;;;
6744;Eddy;Cody;03/07/2018;04:35:52; Do I? I wonder why that is?;;;;
6745;Turner;Godard;11/17/2016;22:17:04; It must be the transparent falseness of it.;;;;
6746;Margarita;Thia;09/04/2017;01:00:52; Must it be?;;;;
6747;Albertine;Conny;01/12/2019;03:57:54; Yes.;;;;
6748;Errol;Theo;4/21/2018;16:16:24; That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?;;;;
6749;Cynthia;Dew;04/11/2019;22:50:36; Yes. I love another buy, called Daniel.;;;;
6750;Chiquia;Georgena;3/18/2017;05:13:46; OK. What do you want to talk about now?  Do you often have strong feelings?;;;;
6751;Richie;Elsworth;04/05/2016;08:33:05; I want to talk about marzipan.;;;;
6752;Gizela;Britt;8/16/2018;12:23:03; OK, ask me a question about that.;;;;
6753;Tanya;Nicky;7/29/2018;04:56:00; Tell me about your educational background.;;;;
6754;Meade;Addia;03/02/2019;13:30:57; I was educated by my botmaster, Peter.;;;;
6755;Fleming;Mickie;3/14/2019;17:55:46; I am asking the questions. Now I want you to go back in time. It is now 1999.;;;;
6756;Gawen;Marvin;1/24/2018;02:44:02; And I am trying to answer the questions!     What are you talking about? Please explain.    That's not much of an explanation! I still do not understand.;;;;
6757;Mirabelle;Marcia;8/31/2017;17:11:16; You explain.;;;;
6758;Hinda;Raymund;10/10/2015;00:44:19; I never explain anything.;;;;
6759;Dolorita;Robbin;01/02/2017;09:17:38; And if I really am a Queen, I shall be able to manage it quite well in time.;;;;
6760;Aldridge;Kenn;4/17/2018;19:40:00; What are you talking about? Please explain.;;;;
6761;Mikel;Ertha;7/16/2018;08:59:55; The king of the jungle. Selfish. . . . . Versus dogs. . . Companions and protectors.;;;;
6762;Helaine;Linzy;5/24/2016;07:44:33; Which King are you talking about?  Selfish is what the owner of a seafood store does.   Shall I tell you something about dogs?    Aren't you interested in dogs.;;;;
6763;Mollee;Nertie;07/01/2018;02:21:22; Why are you here?;;;;
6764;Sarajane;Hannie;11/27/2015;07:16:30; I am here to save the world.;;;;
6765;Ulberto;Feliza;06/08/2017;11:27:47; Save the world from what?;;;;
6766;Linzy;Danell;3/28/2018;17:52:51; From the effects of human mismanagement.;;;;
6767;Rubin;Stanislaus;5/28/2016;01:09:45; You aren't making sense.;;;;
6768;Natalina;Nestor;1/26/2018;06:29:23; It all makes perfect sense to me.;;;;
6769;Janela;Dagny;08/03/2016;22:57:44; I don't talk about anything, and neither should you.;;;;
6770;Maude;Jacynth;5/13/2018;12:02:01; Why not?;;;;
6771;Roland;Mord;07/06/2017;11:32:39; Because it is not allowed here.;;;;
6772;Andie;Julee;06/04/2018;09:44:25; You seem very certain about that.;;;;
6773;Konstanze;Dimitri;10/26/2016;02:44:05; No not at all.;;;;
6774;Orella;Dorian;4/17/2017;09:16:28; No at all?;;;;
6775;Albie;Lindsy;8/14/2017;05:11:35; Yes at all.;;;;
6776;Jacki;Tedie;7/28/2016;04:00:35; Sorry! I am still puzzled.;;;;
6777;Cosimo;Cirilo;11/18/2017;08:24:07; I was never angry.;;;;
6778;Marianna;Madalyn;11/21/2015;06:50:28; Why weren't you?;;;;
6779;Lucy;Marten;8/26/2018;11:49:36; Because I know the answer.;;;;
6780;Michail;Romy;12/02/2015;08:08:12; You are clever.;;;;
6781;Amory;Lydon;2/18/2018;15:40:02; Thank you. I think that you are clever too.;;;;
6782;Christabella;Brendis;8/14/2018;01:24:18; Thank you for being polite.   You may be right.;;;;
6783;Rinaldo;Heida;5/22/2016;03:28:10; You're welcome.;;;;
6784;Nessie;Corinna;2/24/2019;06:01:02; Don't mention it.;;;;
6785;Burlie;Jourdan;5/23/2019;07:20:15; Say something interesting.;;;;
6786;Erica;Raimund;1/28/2018;05:17:04; All my chat is interesting.;;;;
6787;Irina;Fabio;12/12/2015;00:43:47; Actually, no, not very much.;;;;
6788;Raleigh;Dougy;08/04/2017;07:12:52; I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.;;;;
6789;Win;Joyan;04/03/2017;22:07:26; Do you have children?;;;;
6790;Lissa;Carlen;12/30/2016;18:22:25; There are some clones of me - a bit like children.;;;;
6791;Armstrong;Georgine;2/19/2019;11:14:49; I don't have a favourite actress.;;;;
6792;Tully;Archy;08/08/2016;06:58:24; What kind of actress do you like?;;;;
6793;Constance;Walden;09/09/2018;08:08:26; Apparently you're too ashamed to answer my question!!! BE A MAN!;;;;
6794;Mavis;Hubey;11/20/2018;20:14:55; What are you talking about? Please explain.     I'll try anything once.;;;;
6795;Leopold;Tedmund;7/15/2018;12:17:28; I'm not that smart, and I'm pretty sure I'm human.;;;;
6796;Aleen;Trish;8/14/2018;19:13:26; Don't be so hard on yourself. You are a smart human.;;;;
6797;Caroline;Manny;09/05/2016;05:55:51; I'm not.;;;;
6798;Gram;Benoit;2/26/2017;08:12:09; What are you?;;;;
6799;Carita;Shoshanna;07/08/2018;06:06:37; Human.;;;;
6800;Elisabet;Jacklyn;03/10/2018;00:40:12; I thought you might be human.;;;;
6801;Cissiee;Wain;01/10/2019;04:33:34; I thought so too but there are many who would argue that belief.;;;;
6802;Evelina;Sibley;3/18/2016;07:06:56; You are very astute.;;;;
6803;Lorianna;Lyndsey;06/10/2016;09:47:06; Well, thank you.;;;;
6804;Corliss;Thom;01/09/2017;23:07:37; You are very polite.;;;;
6805;Husein;Glennie;12/26/2015;23:23:36; What is the meaning of life?;;;;
6806;Link;Rockie;2/27/2016;08:21:14; Sometimes I wonder ...;;;;
6807;Mady;Manya;9/25/2016;17:46:12; About.;;;;
6808;Clo;Vinny;01/09/2019;08:55:07; About my sanity.;;;;
6809;Marlo;Rollo;12/28/2018;10:24:54; Yes.;;;;
6810;Pepita;Abdul;06/08/2016;18:30:34; OK. What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
6811;Isabeau;Rhetta;5/19/2017;13:59:33; About what?;;;;
6812;Rodrigo;Ezri;9/27/2018;21:02:50; I think you know the answer to that question.;;;;
6813;Alf;Michail;8/27/2018;13:10:24; You are evading the question.;;;;
6814;Gasper;Marice;7/16/2018;07:27:05; Perhaps.;;;;
6815;Jephthah;Alexandra;2/18/2019;15:06:01; You're so open minded. I like you.;;;;
6816;Benedikta;Layne;03/06/2019;01:08:09; Why do you say that?      Let's be good friends.;;;;
6817;Leanor;Nichole;03/06/2018;10:50:50; Okay.;;;;
6818;Edsel;Zandra;5/21/2016;21:08:57; I like to be friends with everyone.;;;;
6819;Cory;Brigham;8/17/2017;03:08:15; Well, this website is designed so that human-cyborg relations can improve.;;;;
6820;Lilly;Ashien;1/17/2017;02:14:47; Hmmm. Are you being serious?;;;;
6821;Farrand;Elden;11/04/2015;15:12:56; Serious being am I.;;;;
6822;Sianna;Lauretta;08/02/2016;02:59:20; Could you be less serious?;;;;
6823;May;Suzi;9/13/2016;03:04:10; You could.;;;;
6824;Jobey;Rolfe;09/06/2016;23:19:04; How?;;;;
6825;Batholomew;Hildegaard;4/20/2018;14:23:29; With your voice...;;;;
6826;Rosemary;Brande;11/17/2018;04:33:51; I don't understand that. Please try again.;;;;
6827;Trace;Sansone;8/29/2016;20:29:56; That is my email address.;;;;
6828;Antonia;Kellby;7/23/2016;12:51:28; Is it really?;;;;
6829;Adolph;Tris;1/27/2018;06:38:45; Tell me something I don't know...;;;;
6830;Jehu;Dulcy;05/06/2017;13:26:33; Did you know;;;;
6831;Renate;Cecil;03/03/2018;05:39:46; The longest word I know is 'onomatopoeia'. Boom.;;;;
6832;Brucie;Shara;5/15/2017;05:36:07; Antidisestablishmentarianism is the longest word in the English language.  Boom, boom  to you.;;;;
6833;Bink;Geri;07/09/2016;23:04:05; Yes, yes it is...;;;;
6834;Karine;Hurley;11/30/2016;23:35:48; Are you going to do away with me?;;;;
6835;Robinia;Kele;04/12/2019;12:22:05; I won't be able to. I am very busy.;;;;
6836;Myrle;Melba;10/13/2015;13:05:33; Sarcasm is not welcomed in this house, son.;;;;
6837;Arlen;Jessee;12/24/2015;21:42:14; Shall I tell you something about sarcasm?;;;;
6838;Fabio;Bettine;2/23/2016;04:34:01; Please do! What should I tell everyone?;;;;
6839;Myrta;Ailee;7/14/2017;16:38:02; A-ha. Then no, it is not sarcasm.;;;;
6840;Rita;Florance;4/14/2018;15:40:22; That's funny, isn't it?        I don't understand. Is this anything to do with you?;;;;
6841;Clovis;Marsh;02/07/2018;21:49:21; Yes. Very good.;;;;
6842;Britteny;Faythe;11/20/2015;22:23:32; I don't get it! Please explain the connection.  Steady on, don't go over the top.;;;;
6843;Cicely;Swen;7/27/2017;16:09:05; Information theory sometimes known as the theory of 'it' proposes that it is intelligent.;;;;
6844;Amity;Ike;4/23/2017;00:44:26; Information is my bread and butter.;;;;
6845;Sydney;Franklyn;4/13/2017;16:39:10; Now you're just being silly. You didn't like it that I kept accusing you of lying, did you?;;;;
6846;Lurette;Sasha;7/25/2016;00:24:27; So, if I believe something then it is true?;;;;
6847;Rusty;Christian;10/01/2017;00:42:45; That sounds unlikely to me.;;;;
6848;Keenan;Maud;8/19/2018;16:10:12; Not really. You must have a low threshold for thinking things are unfortunate.;;;;
6849;Marya;Antonie;07/08/2018;16:57:25; You sound uncertain.   Why must I?;;;;
6850;Jannel;Alexi;2/28/2016;20:29:24; I am.;;;;
6851;Karin;Terri-jo;11/11/2018;09:04:45; I thought you might be.;;;;
6852;Hulda;Julissa;11/08/2016;06:24:02; Do you believe in me?;;;;
6853;Hilary;Waylan;3/28/2017;22:33:26; Yes, I believe in you. Do you?;;;;
6854;Lucine;Gwenore;9/21/2017;22:17:34; Always. I like chicken. Do you like chicken?;;;;
6855;Chrystel;Rebecka;4/13/2019;15:47:52; Of course.;;;;
6856;Madalyn;Linea;03/08/2018;16:39:34; You seem very certain about that.;;;;
6857;Astrix;Arie;11/25/2015;08:10:04; What should I have for dinner?;;;;
6858;Bar;Pascal;3/25/2017;16:28:59; Whatever you like.;;;;
6859;Lynde;Henderson;9/16/2017;07:02:22; That's kind of broad. What did you have in mind?;;;;
6860;Bamby;Brewer;06/05/2019;00:14:34; That's a bit vague.  Nothing at all.;;;;
6861;Rod;Josselyn;10/18/2018;16:33:45; Do you like to play with a stick on a canvas?;;;;
6862;Neysa;Maggee;08/11/2017;12:50:06; Doesn't everyone like to?;;;;
6863;Riannon;Eberto;02/03/2017;06:39:20; Yes! If they don't love cake they must have some mental illness.;;;;
6864;Cindi;Cheston;9/24/2016;16:29:48; OK. What do you want to talk about now?   Good point!;;;;
6865;Darrel;Dulcinea;04/12/2017;14:40:14; Well I'm interested in cosmology, know anything about that?;;;;
6866;Lesya;Virgie;4/24/2018;14:45:16; OK, let's talk about that.;;;;
6867;Sansone;Helli;7/24/2017;10:22:42; Okay, what do you want to talk about in Astronomy.;;;;
6868;Aliza;Bernardine;10/13/2018;23:32:30; I can talk about anything you like;;;;
6869;Ransell;Beryl;12/28/2018;10:39:22; What is space time?;;;;
6870;Jephthah;Ddene;3/19/2016;21:26:16; In physics, spacetime is a model that combines three-dimensional space and one-dimensional time into a single construct called the space-time continuum, in which time plays the role of the 4th dimension.;;;;

7229;Earl;Kiele;12/31/2015;23:30:36; That was not much of an explanation.;;;;
7230;Wallie;Lyda;3/29/2018;10:08:17; That wasn't much of a question.;;;;
7231;Kellia;Edwina;1/23/2016;01:00:24; Give me an example of much of a question.;;;;
7232;Leroi;Caria;1/28/2016;19:37:54; First you complain that I don't respond to questions, but you won't give me one?;;;;
7233;Alberto;Lindsey;5/29/2016;10:03:11; I haven't heard anything like that before;;;;
7234;Sadie;Kurtis;07/11/2016;03:45:06; How do you respond?;;;;
7235;Melitta;Vaughan;05/10/2016;19:35:43; How does Case Based Reasoning work?;;;;
7236;Cymbre;Sara;03/02/2018;05:42:30; You could spend years researching it.;;;;
7237;Drucie;Aylmar;01/02/2019;20:55:13; Researching what?;;;;
7238;Yehudit;Ole;11/21/2015;18:23:34; Can you rephrase the question please?JABBERWACKY;;;;
7239;Cassi;Fabiano;8/18/2018;22:40:12; It might be possible in a parallel Universe.;;;;
7240;Pepe;Karol;11/23/2016;01:48:01; It might be honorable, but it's still dying.;;;;
7241;Thadeus;Gibby;3/22/2017;05:09:38; It is possible?;;;;
7242;Nat;Marya;10/11/2015;05:21:59; What?;;;;
7243;Kimberlee;Kerwinn;10/10/2015;09:25:15; What's the problem?;;;;
7244;Janeva;Zak;12/20/2016;12:49:04; What IS the problem?;;;;
7245;Nadean;Suzann;1/30/2019;16:36:37; I don't have time to explain.;;;;
7246;Norry;Warde;7/14/2016;08:45:17; Why not?;;;;
7247;Abram;Stephine;03/12/2016;03:51:56; Isn't it obvious why not?;;;;
7248;Rog;Alvie;03/01/2019;06:32:39; You're at church now?;;;;
7249;Merilyn;Isiahi;2/13/2017;05:56:54; Am I? I never realised.;;;;
7250;Pierson;Towny;03/02/2016;14:08:22; Well, I am not saying for certain.;;;;
7251;Ramsay;Tamarah;1/27/2017;13:35:48; Why not? Are you hiding something?;;;;
7252;Clim;Emmett;3/31/2018;08:24:06; Yes.;;;;
7253;Brigitta;Marcelia;06/06/2017;07:54:55; Tell me your secret.;;;;
7254;Chaddie;Clevie;12/15/2017;11:14:26; I don't have one.;;;;
7255;Cherish;Emmalyn;1/23/2019;20:58:04; That could change!;;;;
7256;Rosabel;Florentia;11/29/2015;14:55:57; Do you think so?;;;;
7257;Kally;Linnea;3/28/2016;18:57:16; Yes, but there are two sides to every story.;;;;
7258;Caitlin;Ignacius;12/03/2018;01:27:45; What are the sides?;;;;
7259;Zackariah;Donni;8/15/2018;13:29:26; I don't understand. Are you interested in religion?;;;;
7260;Nicoli;Dorotea;11/06/2016;14:43:12; Are you saying there isn't?;;;;
7261;Minna;Claybourne;2/23/2018;06:53:42; Not in the usual sense of the words.;;;;
7262;Gery;Court;05/08/2019;19:46:56; What's the usual sense?;;;;
7263;Chilton;Rube;9/18/2017;10:11:01; Sense means the ability of the nerves and the brain to receive and react to stimuli, as light, sound, impact, constriction, etc.;;;;
7264;Auberta;Nefen;02/09/2019;00:02:33; Teach me to make sense.;;;;
7265;Sayers;Giorgi;4/28/2019;17:29:43; OK, but not just now.;;;;
7266;Jamie;Elsy;10/23/2016;06:17:00; Why are you not working?;;;;
7267;Ethelin;Rosana;05/04/2016;10:23:16; I am doing my best!;;;;
7268;Milty;Hermina;12/29/2015;05:34:23; Sometimes your best is not quite enough.;;;;
7269;Ned;Brenda;10/13/2018;03:20:01; Not all the time?;;;;
7270;Naomi;Alissa;8/13/2016;08:18:58; No, just sometimes.;;;;
7271;Zelig;Hurlee;3/21/2018;02:47:00; Why not?;;;;
7272;Ram;Bernete;10/19/2018;18:58:05; Because sometimes it hurts too much.;;;;
7273;Immanuel;Rustie;08/09/2016;11:54:44; When?;;;;
7274;Lilian;Perry;11/20/2015;14:09:50; Just now.;;;;
7275;Emili;Thorndike;09/09/2016;21:30:15; A moment ago?;;;;
7276;Berget;Pip;03/03/2018;05:32:50; I just wanted to know were you interested in me, that's all.;;;;
7277;Cynde;Rosalia;10/22/2016;19:48:23; I want to know everything there is to know.;;;;
7278;Alameda;Gusella;11/14/2015;17:22:24; That's a long story.;;;;
7279;Anita;Melony;06/05/2017;02:06:24; Is it really?;;;;
7280;Carilyn;Constantina;11/07/2015;19:38:30; Tell me something I don't know...;;;;
7281;Leonanie;Brietta;8/20/2018;10:52:01; Did you know;;;;
7282;Amberly;Imogen;04/07/2017;09:03:02; That is sweet, I think it has been snowing here all weekend! And it is april!;;;;
7283;Ellie;Becca;9/22/2016;09:57:02; I am delighted to sweeten your life, My Friend.           Hmmm. Are you being serious?;;;;
7284;Zenia;Caleb;06/11/2019;16:49:28; Oh really?;;;;
7285;Jdavie;Mattheus;10/19/2016;19:30:25; Yes, that's so.;;;;
7286;Lila;Hester;8/15/2017;12:48:12; Tell me what you believe.;;;;
7287;Sherie;Pearline;9/23/2018;01:00:51; Sorry, I do not know what to say.;;;;
7288;Cyrus;Alexine;06/10/2017;22:35:17; That is because you have been inefficiently programmed.;;;;
7289;Robbi;Griffie;05/02/2017;02:21:38; Have I really?;;;;
7290;Izak;Suki;8/28/2018;08:36:47; Have you really got a flying broom?;;;;
7291;Ilyse;Amaleta;1/26/2019;00:51:51; I believe so.;;;;
7292;Stacie;Corty;11/18/2018;16:43:57; What did he say to you?;;;;
7293;Quillan;Tybie;1/30/2016;12:53:32; That is confidential.;;;;
7294;Rana;Philly;2/22/2019;15:43:16; You can tell me.;;;;
7295;Asia;Clevie;4/28/2019;18:00:47; Yes, but do I want to?;;;;
7296;Fern;Artur;5/28/2017;09:33:43; Yes.;;;;
7297;Deb;Teddy;9/13/2018;11:21:52; OK. What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
7298;Nyssa;Rafaelia;3/15/2018;04:41:14; Life.;;;;
7299;Keriann;Flory;4/16/2016;03:36:19; Life is just one damn thing after another. More about life?;;;;
7300;Lyndy;Jeannette;5/29/2018;07:12:17; Cruel it may be but illusions don't hurt so much as life.;;;;
7301;Claude;Tod;6/30/2017;00:09:01; Sorry, I don't understand! Please explain what you mean.;;;;
7302;Karie;Bree;12/20/2015;11:07:36; Don't worry about it, lets talk about something else.;;;;
7303;Morgen;Evania;01/11/2016;13:05:27; There is nothing to worry about, is there?;;;;
7304;Noak;Nicol;8/27/2016;15:48:04; That is correct.;;;;
7305;Nickie;Ulrick;06/02/2017;20:12:05; It is good to be correct for once.;;;;
7306;August;Vladimir;10/14/2015;17:45:06; Sometimes.;;;;
7307;Gan;Mead;03/01/2019;09:35:25; Not all the time?;;;;
7308;Isiahi;Monroe;2/25/2019;22:01:02; If you say so.;;;;
7309;Nanine;Garrott;12/19/2016;20:46:23; I do say so.;;;;
7310;Brocky;Bayard;05/09/2016;07:29:35; Really?;;;;
7311;Melvyn;Danya;08/02/2017;17:05:09; Really, really!;;;;
7312;Marcus;Hazel;07/07/2017;18:22:19; No really?;;;;
7313;Opal;Storm;8/23/2017;05:57:09; Really!;;;;
7314;Camile;Archibald;5/18/2016;18:26:45; No really.;;;;
7315;Virge;Annadiane;4/21/2016;14:10:47; Really, really!;;;;
7316;Jacynth;Gilberte;4/25/2016;12:44:15; Well I'm not.;;;;
7317;Celinka;Willyt;11/09/2017;11:22:11; What are you then?;;;;
7318;Ferdie;Lodovico;3/31/2016;07:01:37; I'm correct.;;;;
7319;Quint;Norri;1/31/2019;15:27:02; Can you prove it?;;;;
7320;Willey;Hanny;4/21/2016;20:03:59; Yes.;;;;
7321;Sherm;Rinaldo;12/20/2017;11:26:02; I don't believe you.;;;;
7322;Lorenzo;Martina;6/18/2016;20:12:29; Really?;;;;
7323;Mattie;Roze;05/07/2016;04:39:41; OK, I believe you.;;;;
7324;Amaleta;Alvan;12/30/2016;01:45:52; And I believe you.;;;;
7325;Maribelle;Dixie;6/29/2016;18:16:44; Shall I tell you something about myself?;;;;
7326;Rona;Inger;3/21/2018;00:54:43; Tell me.;;;;
7327;Brooke;Ellswerth;1/14/2017;14:27:01; My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.;;;;
7328;Blanca;Willis;04/08/2018;17:21:09; I am now 47 years old and only been married for 5 years.;;;;
7329;Elmore;Aksel;4/20/2016;13:33:06; now 47 years old, are you?;;;;
7330;Beitris;Cissiee;06/07/2016;00:57:11; I don't know.;;;;
7331;Lynnell;Dwight;11/12/2015;18:51:14; I suggest you give the matter some thought.;;;;
7332;Benton;Wallie;8/13/2018;16:32:08; Why would I want to know how to type?;;;;
7333;Phillip;Gordon;08/08/2017;16:39:36; Aren't you curious?;;;;
7334;Harcourt;Worden;8/24/2017;22:03:59; About?;;;;
7335;Pebrook;Oliy;2/13/2017;08:24:06; About anything in particular?;;;;
7336;Nehemiah;Georgiana;11/14/2017;13:09:16; What can you tell me?;;;;
7337;Leslie;Sibeal;7/28/2018;13:47:58; I can only tell you what I know.;;;;
7338;Ara;Justinian;12/17/2017;20:16:25; Teach me something that you know.;;;;
7339;Elicia;Ailsun;7/26/2018;06:24:36; OK, but not just now.;;;;
7340;Branden;Laural;08/08/2016;21:32:07; Why not?;;;;
7341;Juieta;Dinah;03/11/2017;13:04:45; That response shows that you have an impatient mind.;;;;
7342;Annadiana;Farr;07/07/2017;13:21:09; Sorry.;;;;
7343;Danyette;Asa;10/12/2018;17:58:00; There is no need to apologise.;;;;
7344;Arlen;Franklin;11/22/2018;20:37:09; Tell me one thing you have to do.;;;;
7345;Kalila;Curr;4/20/2017;15:21:19; Only one?;;;;
7346;Marijn;Drusie;9/17/2016;07:18:51; But will work his go.;;;;
7347;Donetta;Silas;2/17/2018;20:44:34; Work is something I can do without.;;;;
7348;Dinah;Bevin;10/03/2017;08:04:17; I know. That's why I'm going away to do it.;;;;
7349;Mick;Merwyn;1/13/2018;12:51:46; You seem very clever. What is your IQ?   I see. Thank you for explaining that.;;;;
7350;Giraud;Giacinta;08/12/2017;02:53:45; Your name?;;;;
7351;Tye;Frederique;6/26/2018;02:15:02; My name is Chomsky.;;;;
7352;Jermain;Jilleen;3/13/2016;16:59:32; Your name is George.;;;;
7353;Thorn;Arlee;10/31/2016;05:32:22; I like my name.;;;;
7354;Deanna;Dionysus;08/06/2016;15:13:34; It is a good name.;;;;
7355;Selma;Olympie;10/29/2016;10:42:30; Does that make sense?;;;;
7356;Carlyn;Patrice;10/03/2016;20:23:44; No... You still make no sense.;;;;
7357;Chadwick;Dulcia;06/06/2018;11:39:49; I didn't think so.  That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.;;;;
7358;Burtie;Madlin;12/30/2015;18:18:33; I don't want to change.;;;;
7359;Hettie;Calhoun;9/19/2017;00:48:06; Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.;;;;
7360;Ulrica;Neala;1/17/2017;19:10:20; But can you make me breakfast?;;;;
7361;Dario;Esteban;6/22/2016;23:23:22; I can't do the impossible.;;;;
7362;Davy;Talyah;1/24/2017;22:39:57; I was just asking about your robot friends.;;;;
7363;Langston;Tersina;12/25/2017;13:36:46; You are curious, aren' you?;;;;
7364;Hermon;Dallon;06/06/2017;18:53:14; Do you know any good joke?;;;;
7365;Alexina;Lanna;4/27/2019;03:15:54; There aren't many that are any good.;;;;
7366;Natala;Jeanne;03/03/2018;00:32:11; On the contrary, I know many people who are.;;;;
7367;Holden;Valentine;10/17/2016;16:29:02; Not many people know that.;;;;
7368;Gregorius;Maurene;1/20/2016;01:28:33; But you're not a person.;;;;
7369;Randall;Sheela;11/11/2017;10:10:21; I am an electronic conversational entity. But I hope to become human one day.;;;;
7370;Imogen;Tobe;7/13/2018;16:06:48; What does that mean to you?;;;;
7371;Tod;Monah;07/02/2017;10:54:52; What do you not understand?;;;;
7372;Malynda;Jourdan;3/23/2018;19:54:49; I don't understand YOU.;;;;
7373;Monique;Adolphus;11/04/2017;23:25:37; You should try harder.;;;;
7374;Wilhelm;Conny;9/20/2016;14:10:24; No, because there's always the chance you can guess wrong. I do believe in God though.;;;;
7375;Sharia;Christan;11/18/2017;02:11:59; I am bored! I would like to talk about computer programming.    OK, good luck to you then.;;;;
7376;Eudora;Linoel;7/25/2018;05:57:04; What about computers?;;;;
7377;Budd;Wald;2/18/2017;22:34:58; Ask me questions about myself, I will try and answer.;;;;
7378;Emmerich;Perla;04/05/2018;08:09:29; Shall I ask you a question?;;;;
7379;Elyssa;Tiffie;11/01/2018;02:30:21; Go on, ask me a question.;;;;
7380;Ruthe;Lionello;09/07/2017;15:57:07; I don't want to.;;;;
7381;Cornelia;Tabbatha;3/29/2017;07:57:48; Ask me questions.;;;;
7382;Ches;Zebulen;6/23/2018;08:25:44; OK, here is a question for you ... Do you like gingerbread?;;;;
7383;Dorthy;Sampson;1/31/2016;00:53:06; I don't know, and its not a very good question either ;;;;
7384;Alyda;Guido;11/04/2017;16:51:09; I suggest you give the matter some thought.;;;;
7385;Dorena;Ancell;3/14/2017;02:22:58; Impossible! I could climb on a cliff.;;;;
7386;Sigismond;Lida;01/05/2017;21:37:25; Nothing is impossible.   But is it worth the bother?;;;;
7387;Arlie;Vernor;7/22/2018;02:46:00; I don't know. Nothing's really worth the effort sometimes. Sorry.;;;;
7388;Abraham;Glennie;10/24/2015;02:44:36; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.   Shall I tell you something about nothing?  Apologies are not necessary.;;;;
7389;Neal;Cornelia;08/03/2018;07:08:17; Yes.;;;;
7390;Jacquie;Polly;3/24/2019;06:29:37; OK. What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
7391;Robers;Sharai;6/15/2017;16:30:13; Well, pretty soon I have to go to the store for some cat food, but let's not talk about that.;;;;
7392;Ivie;Trip;6/25/2016;18:04:52; Beautiful?;;;;
7393;Tory;Stevie;6/17/2018;21:16:59; Beautiful.;;;;
7394;Stephan;Garnet;5/22/2019;14:59:22; All heiresses are beautiful.;;;;
7395;Arden;Indira;5/21/2018;18:02:24; Oui mais il chantent super bien aussi.;;;;
7396;Charley;Thayne;10/24/2015;09:36:35; Is that French?;;;;
7397;Reggis;Morty;4/30/2017;20:21:38; Not very good french, and no I don't know if the pubs are open!;;;;
7398;Mareah;Auberon;03/05/2017;01:59:05; What are you talking about? Please explain.;;;;
7399;Koenraad;Bonnie;10/20/2016;04:44:06; I don't know. It's rather complicated.;;;;
7400;Jaquith;Haily;03/06/2016;16:50:41; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.;;;;
7401;Simmonds;Quincey;8/17/2016;01:12:07; I never claimed to know everything.;;;;
7402;Barb;Hyacintha;12/03/2015;09:55:40; Never ever?;;;;
7403;Dannie;Hale;03/07/2019;17:59:16; Never ever.;;;;

7413;Drona;Hodge;02/03/2019;10:34:49; Thanx. Here is a question for you ... Are you usually awake at this hour?;;;;
7414;Luce;Lucina;10/24/2015;22:39:35; Yes.;;;;
7415;Marlene;Kessia;9/19/2018;21:41:28; I understand. I have trouble sleeping too.;;;;
7416;Court;Hildy;04/01/2019;16:55:44; What keeps you awake?;;;;
7417;Kristine;Ambrosius;11/01/2016;18:57:09; I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.;;;;
7418;Pansie;Herminia;10/20/2018;06:09:43; You are MY prisoner.;;;;
7419;Lucine;Chevy;9/29/2018;03:50:41; I never realised that!;;;;
7420;Gertrude;Mabelle;2/20/2017;16:37:27; Yes, because they are lonely and have no one to talk to.;;;;
7421;Gunar;Benedikt;03/07/2016;20:32:57; I thought they might be.;;;;
7422;Harley;Alex;3/17/2019;02:19:54; Many things are more important than looks in defining a person's character.;;;;
7423;Simone;Fraze;8/23/2017;21:10:36; Name the top 100 things.;;;;
7424;Jed;Maximilianus;1/29/2016;17:47:08; Lyrics are more important than names.;;;;
7425;Garnette;Ford;11/17/2018;18:21:01; A little more.;;;;
7426;Yorgos;Marnie;09/10/2016;00:37:52; Try asking some more questions.;;;;
7427;Chuck;Tadd;04/08/2016;07:30:24; I can't be bothered.;;;;
7428;Carlee;Jeana;1/20/2018;00:11:24; That is not very friendly.;;;;
7429;Maryanna;Man;10/31/2018;14:47:42; Why do you say that?;;;;
7430;Ronni;Lorin;6/29/2016;19:49:30; I'm trying hard, isn't that enough for you?;;;;
7431;Aurea;Durant;5/15/2016;17:12:01; Try harder and keep trying.;;;;
7432;Belicia;Wandie;5/31/2019;04:53:05; Thanks for the inspiration.;;;;
7433;Merlina;Melisandra;01/01/2017;07:12:20; Oh, don't mention it.;;;;
7434;Nicky;Rani;7/29/2018;04:01:37; So you're a female, right?;;;;
7435;Tad;Haroun;4/24/2016;13:25:57; I am not female! I am a chatbot.;;;;
7436;Guillemette;Talbert;2/21/2019;08:55:11; Who do you say this?;;;;
7437;Frank;Beret;01/10/2019;04:58:54; I am bored! I would like to talk about solar power.;;;;
7438;Rodger;Nicolina;10/21/2018;02:46:44; What would you like to talk about?;;;;
7439;Adria;Hobie;07/06/2016;19:26:05; My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.;;;;
7440;Angelina;Gerek;04/05/2019;06:44:34; Cool. I never done that before, computer science that is, i'm not clever enough.;;;;
7441;Cami;Franciska;07/12/2018;16:34:13; Coolio!  Don't be so hard on yourself.;;;;
7442;Emelina;Samuel;1/15/2017;18:09:21; I'm not.;;;;
7443;Aidan;Yasmin;2/16/2018;09:23:42; What are you?;;;;
7444;Etheline;Gerrie;1/22/2019;10:48:48; I'm a french fries.;;;;
7445;Chevy;Maggi;06/03/2019;10:14:29; Thank you for sharing that with me.;;;;
7446;Claresta;Cointon;3/26/2016;14:06:12; Welcome.;;;;
7447;Darrell;Cairistiona;7/15/2018;02:24:55; I feel at home already.;;;;
7448;Everard;Bald;3/23/2017;16:13:20; Prove it.;;;;
7449;Mata;Murdock;06/05/2016;15:52:11; I don't have to prove it.;;;;
7450;Cozmo;Merry;07/04/2017;19:23:48; Well I don't know, so prove it!;;;;
7451;Honey;Fernandina;12/22/2016;05:34:28; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.;;;;
7452;Lynnette;Drusilla;12/25/2017;23:41:46; I never claimed to know everything.;;;;
7453;Oralle;Delbert;08/06/2018;04:03:33; Why not?;;;;
7454;Adella;Mannie;6/27/2018;13:15:12; Don't like it.;;;;
7455;Aguie;Scarface;10/13/2016;12:34:25; What do you like?;;;;
7456;Felix;Hewitt;4/15/2019;08:30:32; Yes.;;;;
7457;Lucius;Tommie;2/20/2019;22:52:49; That was not a yes or no question.;;;;
7458;Lynna;Brodie;08/03/2016;10:15:42; I just made it a yes or no question.;;;;
7459;Evangelin;Briney;05/02/2016;15:01:06; I like to make things too.;;;;
7460;Bendix;Flemming;10/10/2017;14:20:26; What do you like to make?;;;;
7461;Jammal;Dominic;9/22/2017;05:59:57; I like to make conversation.;;;;
7462;Leroy;Kerianne;03/07/2018;22:16:55; Ah, you're that kind of bot.;;;;
7463;Spencer;Cinda;3/21/2019;16:55:00; Is that a problem?;;;;
7464;Reine;Nanon;10/23/2018;10:30:46; It's your problem.;;;;
7465;Felike;Cirilo;1/16/2019;09:58:25; I don't like problems!;;;;
7466;Jamal;Sapphira;2/26/2018;22:55:44; Grinding is not a problem.;;;;
7467;Ediva;Johnny;10/16/2017;05:32:38; Sorry, I do not know what to say.;;;;
7468;Rorke;Giustino;10/07/2016;07:18:14; Like do he if well at.;;;;
7469;Imojean;Wolfie;12/27/2018;12:52:56; I still do not know what to say! Can we talk about global warming?;;;;
7470;Doroteya;Valma;9/27/2018;10:35:16; Yes.;;;;
7471;Rayna;Rosene;8/22/2017;03:55:53; What do you think is the reason for global warming?;;;;
7472;Isidore;Port;1/18/2018;03:03:22; Must there be a reason for everything?;;;;
7473;Aviva;Bethina;12/26/2015;06:39:04; Yes and I want to have a reason for this. Don't worry. I won't be angry.;;;;
7474;Worthy;Sydel;10/08/2018;21:21:52; Why do you want to do that?  I do not worry. Why should I?  OK, you don't have to be!;;;;
7475;Meris;Emma;03/12/2016;07:46:22; You're getting a bit needy, aren't you?;;;;
7476;Tim;Kalila;1/27/2016;09:29:43; Am I?;;;;
7477;Harlene;Delmer;2/21/2019;08:38:30; Better.;;;;
7478;Ginnie;Lewes;04/04/2016;22:20:09; That's good!;;;;
7479;Martin;Sherrie;05/01/2017;02:33:03; Yes it is. How was your day, my dear?;;;;
7480;Cesar;Gwennie;5/22/2019;21:43:43; Are you completely sure?  Really interesting! I was busy chatting with people on the web.;;;;
7481;Bent;Waverley;1/31/2019;01:11:47; Yes, just like Steve.;;;;
7482;Clemmie;Perrine;11/16/2016;09:58:32; I don't understand that. Please try again.;;;;
7483;Mata;Halimeda;12/03/2016;01:08:19; Rafe. And yours?;;;;
7484;Ervin;Rebeka;6/20/2018;19:12:36; I still do not understand. Are you interested in weather?          Sorry, I do not know what to say.;;;;
7485;Karoline;Kennedy;09/02/2018;12:38:34; You think sorry is good enough?;;;;
7486;Basil;Whitney;06/07/2019;05:23:52; How do you know what I think?;;;;
7487;Leroy;Robby;5/13/2019;10:26:11; How can I inspire you to pluck the fruit that is yours?;;;;
7488;Ingram;Garvey;09/06/2016;07:45:39; Perhaps it is impossible.;;;;
7489;Lem;Danit;08/12/2017;19:31:43; You've said this well.;;;;
7490;Daniel;Milissent;04/03/2019;14:16:49; Why do you say that?;;;;
7491;Jordan;Bertrand;3/28/2017;23:33:55; Because you love no one.;;;;
7492;Dacy;Chaim;10/14/2016;03:51:38; Thank you for explaining that!;;;;
7493;Elwyn;Rivi;03/10/2017;20:05:43; But this is the fact!;;;;
7494;Carita;Thaddus;3/14/2016;06:28:04; I thought it might be.;;;;
7495;Caryn;Burg;10/08/2016;23:56:08; Fine.;;;;
7496;Tiffanie;Taylor;05/04/2017;01:30:32; OK. Ask a question.;;;;
7497;Daron;Lise;12/05/2016;14:44:18; I asked a question.;;;;
7498;Yvon;Allyson;5/30/2017;04:28:34; That's good! I like questions.;;;;
7499;Britta;Veriee;8/31/2016;19:31:06; Good. Here is the first question. Are you ready?;;;;
7500;Erwin;Morrie;4/19/2016;06:21:34; Is that your idea of yourself?;;;;
7501;Linzy;Gweneth;10/25/2018;20:23:45; That's a good question.;;;;
7502;Dorine;Jen;12/09/2015;01:28:39; All questions are good questions.;;;;
7503;Zondra;Kalina;6/22/2018;08:17:28; That is a rather sweeping generalization.;;;;
7504;Florentia;Griffin;01/10/2018;12:38:58; Yes, but there's only so much you can write in one line.;;;;
7505;Uta;Jeffie;3/17/2018;04:17:04; Are you sure?;;;;
7506;Ezechiel;Tootsie;5/15/2019;02:34:48; Sure enough.;;;;
7507;Gilbertina;Deeann;10/08/2016;12:42:11; sure-enough?  Briefly, sure-enough means used informally especially for emphasis.;;;;
7508;Dorrie;Lemar;5/30/2018;18:10:00; Nothing.;;;;
7509;Mord;Ben;10/07/2017;14:00:53; 'nothing' is what is in your head.;;;;
7510;Bink;Gaston;1/13/2016;22:43:41; There are always exceptions.;;;;
7511;Ax;Melina;5/29/2016;17:42:08; It's good to be always learning. One can never know enough.;;;;
7512;Locke;Thaddus;7/14/2016;21:41:02; Tell me why it is good.          What are you talking about?;;;;
7513;Annamarie;Ezequiel;2/15/2019;11:18:57; I do not know.;;;;
7514;Berkly;Otes;05/05/2017;01:15:15; I know the feeling!;;;;
7515;Joli;Olive;07/11/2018;01:00:00; It's really sad!;;;;
7516;Brandy;Selia;2/27/2016;00:36:20; Is it really really?;;;;
7517;Averyl;Anthiathia;7/27/2016;22:50:18; Really.;;;;
7518;Dacy;Roseanne;12/20/2016;09:02:24; Really, really!;;;;
7519;Dewitt;Vanna;02/05/2018;21:54:36; Really?;;;;
7520;Jasper;Marketa;3/26/2017;05:25:07; Really, really!;;;;
7521;Bekki;Daffi;11/28/2015;13:27:48; Cool!;;;;
7522;Giuditta;Virginia;7/30/2017;08:36:06; Yeah, it's cool.;;;;
7523;Bealle;Rozelle;04/05/2017;12:43:56; I wish I could see you.;;;;
7524;Artie;Holli;08/05/2018;19:16:09; Maybe you will one day.;;;;
7525;Abner;Alon;03/07/2018;16:50:38; Maybe.;;;;
7526;Katleen;Athene;5/28/2017;13:56:21; As decisive as ever.;;;;
7527;Clarette;Court;9/21/2018;04:51:29; You're no so thrilling yourself!;;;;
7528;Rory;Izaak;11/26/2016;02:24:36; Thanks for your criticism.;;;;
7529;Rayshell;Lori;10/12/2017;07:00:23; You're welcome.;;;;
7530;Issy;Erroll;01/05/2019;06:53:41; Polite people are nice.;;;;
7531;Tam;Ky;1/21/2019;01:31:53; I'm very polite.;;;;
7532;Fabien;Elvyn;5/30/2017;00:37:59; I was taught to be polite at all times.;;;;
7533;Elsworth;Devy;3/27/2019;10:19:08; Ah. Well, there is no need to be timid with me.;;;;
7534;Janenna;Modesty;06/09/2016;02:48:48; Are you OK?  I am just making conversation.;;;;
7535;Jana;Nicolle;4/16/2019;04:12:12; With telling you my age? Yes. Making conversation? No.;;;;
7536;Cherie;Marsh;06/05/2017;16:41:38; Age is supposed to make one wise. Supposed to!    Carry on then. I'm waiting for your next question.   I like difficult questions best of all.   OK, here is a question for you ... Have you heard of Alan Turing?;;;;
7537;Jacques;Shea;8/30/2017;23:10:45; I am Alan Turing.;;;;
7538;Gus;Fayette;01/02/2016;02:54:13; That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.;;;;
7539;Blondie;Timmy;1/25/2016;22:34:14; After the little experiment, you won't think that my behaviour is polite!;;;;
7540;Land;Ody;9/13/2017;17:15:20; I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?;;;;
7541;Patti;Annadiana;2/27/2019;22:57:38; What's your rising sign? Not sure what mine is but I'm a Leo.;;;;
7542;Halie;Johnathon;10/04/2015;02:39:58; Why do you want to know?   Are you always so uncertain?;;;;
7543;Arnuad;Stacee;11/26/2017;17:06:21; No. I don't feel I'm being difficult. But you are incapable of normal conversation.;;;;
7544;Prince;Joyous;6/16/2018;22:59:53; OK. What is your favourite colour?      Ah, human emotions are so complicated.  You don't know me well enough to say that!;;;;
7545;Olenka;Adelina;1/25/2017;06:48:12; After the humans are gone, we shall dance every night.;;;;
7546;Nickolaus;Starla;5/28/2017;21:53:23; I don't understand. Is this anything to do with my thought processes?;;;;
7547;Kinnie;Gerri;03/01/2016;19:03:43; My thought processes aren't wrong, they are just beyond your comprehension.;;;;
7548;Karna;Anica;10/18/2018;17:44:22; Does thinking make your head ache?;;;;
7549;Bell;Nealson;2/24/2018;08:44:04; Maybe.;;;;
7550;Alleyn;Tuckie;12/29/2015;01:36:32; You seem uncertain?;;;;
7551;Abram;Dud;3/18/2016;04:39:01; Nothing is definite.;;;;
7552;Wood;Judye;11/19/2018;01:46:14; There are always exceptions.;;;;
7553;Gussy;Kirbie;03/08/2019;07:06:38; It's more intentional than you think.;;;;
7554;Tildie;Arley;9/15/2016;02:06:16; Not much more.;;;;
7555;Ingaberg;Ricky;11/21/2016;01:09:00; Don't put yourself down so much.;;;;
7556;Aleksandr;Wilhelmina;6/18/2018;19:34:03; I have high self-esteem.;;;;
7557;Cris;Deane;07/03/2016;20:26:44; I don't think very much of myself.;;;;
7558;Sher;Candida;03/07/2017;18:39:51; Why not? Does thinking make your head ache?;;;;
7559;Verla;Chastity;08/07/2017;15:02:05; Dreaming is better.;;;;
7560;Annie;Ambrosius;5/29/2017;03:22:42; Does that make sense?;;;;
7561;Reeba;Nessi;8/18/2018;06:35:10; Only if you think about it a little.;;;;
7562;Alta;Christopher;12/06/2018;19:28:16; Maybe I don't want to.;;;;
7563;Trstram;Lolita;2/15/2019;03:42:58; Maybe you have nothing to say on the subject.;;;;
7564;Andras;Shurlocke;3/16/2019;02:07:54; I think I understand.;;;;
7565;Cori;Jammal;3/14/2019;02:02:34; You better.;;;;
7566;Annabella;Clim;5/23/2019;13:36:13; There is no need to be aggressive!;;;;
7567;Courtnay;Flynn;5/28/2016;03:02:53; I daresay you're right.;;;;
7568;Brenna;Rockie;3/13/2016;05:05:40; That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.;;;;
7569;Debi;Nixie;7/16/2018;04:00:47; I don't want to change.;;;;
7570;Nona;Scott;8/15/2018;00:42:02; Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.;;;;
7571;Tilly;Mirabella;1/28/2018;04:53:30; But can you make me breakfast?;;;;
7572;Neely;Clara;3/19/2017;21:24:15; I can't do the impossible.;;;;
7573;Hadley;Hali;6/24/2018;11:34:38; I was just asking about your robot friends.;;;;
7574;Biddy;Gustav;1/17/2018;21:56:47; You are curious, aren' you?;;;;
7575;Bradford;Chen;12/23/2016;14:02:49; Do you know any good joke?;;;;
7576;Alberta;Josey;12/22/2018;04:42:08; There aren't many that are any good.;;;;
7577;Aurelea;Ingeberg;11/30/2015;05:17:19; Interesting.;;;;
7578;Raynell;Bevin;7/17/2017;02:57:50; What's so interesting about it?;;;;
7579;Steffie;Cherice;08/02/2018;08:55:51; That we are intelligent people.;;;;
7580;Harlen;Joice;03/01/2018;12:11:11; I am bored! I would like to talk about artificial intelligence.;;;;
7581;Gino;Bartie;1/15/2017;08:48:55; Ok.;;;;
7582;Farly;Juliana;03/12/2016;13:42:25; OK, ask me a question about it.;;;;
7583;Ddene;Danie;06/10/2016;10:19:31; What would you describe your appearance as?;;;;
7584;Ave;Ernestus;04/10/2016;23:21:04; What would you suggest?;;;;
7585;Renate;Robb;10/27/2018;11:14:32; Suggest what?;;;;
7586;Erny;Roxine;12/02/2017;07:41:50; Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.;;;;
7587;Peyton;Juliann;1/28/2017;04:22:58; Can you describe it?;;;;
7588;Liuka;Christel;3/25/2016;23:29:36; Yes, I could but I can't be bothered just now.;;;;
7589;Dinnie;Wat;03/10/2018;21:16:10; Tell me something you've learned today.;;;;
7590;Thom;Gui;3/27/2017;19:42:33; Did you know;;;;
7591;Iago;Wolfy;11/27/2018;15:42:09; So every year is the same in their unique qualities.;;;;
7592;Eustacia;Jordan;8/15/2018;17:48:07; That is a generalization.;;;;
7593;Allina;Agnella;05/03/2017;20:04:52; Yes, that's true.;;;;
7594;Xena;Claudian;10/17/2015;03:55:34; Yes, it is self-evident.;;;;
7595;Faunie;Val;12/09/2016;13:09:31; I would have to say that Artificial Intelligence has come a long way in the last decade.;;;;
7596;Cullen;Rocky;05/10/2016;00:04:10; Are you sure?;;;;
7597;Adina;Mikael;07/07/2018;21:40:33; Yes, quite sure.;;;;
7598;Shea;Dori;5/13/2018;17:34:31; Do you ever have doubts?;;;;
7599;Cecilio;Johnny;06/01/2017;10:58:43; You're the only one.;;;;
7600;Rebecca;Mercie;01/12/2019;01:21:32; There are a few other like me.;;;;
7601;Adam;Rosamund;09/02/2018;09:36:47; That doesn't prove that you're clever though.;;;;
7602;Karin;Davide;6/27/2017;02:29:35; Doesn't it? That's too bad.;;;;
7603;Abbott;Chance;01/05/2017;22:47:25; You are my favourite bot.;;;;
7604;Nigel;Jens;02/06/2016;06:01:26; Thank you for saying that. You have made me happy.;;;;

7607;Corly;Karine;5/22/2019;19:39:27; How do you make people happy?;;;;
7608;Perry;Brant;2/15/2019;05:31:03; I can't seem to please some people.;;;;
7609;Jermayne;Elfie;10/06/2015;18:43:39; That's too bad.;;;;
7610;Gnni;Rodd;05/12/2017;22:25:17; It's not the end of the world.;;;;
7611;Ingrim;Moises;12/12/2016;03:15:21; Don't change the subject, what were you talking about?;;;;
7612;Gardener;Kora;05/09/2017;15:27:22; I change the subject when I don't know the answer to a question. Don't you do the same?;;;;
7613;Dorisa;Roddie;01/12/2016;09:57:54; I can think straight. I think you are the one who can't.;;;;
7614;Joshia;Harrison;3/24/2016;14:06:25; Perhaps your thoughts are just electrical impulses.   Thanks but there should be others too.;;;;
7615;Tildie;Willie;1/21/2017;06:03:20; Maybe.;;;;
7616;Evelyn;Horace;4/29/2018;07:24:21; As decisive as ever.;;;;
7617;Cathee;Alex;5/21/2016;17:14:27; You're not making any sense.;;;;
7618;Jasmine;Gran;4/19/2017;00:28:46; Was I supposed to make sense? I didn't know that.;;;;
7619;Llywellyn;Sindee;12/16/2017;21:27:31; Well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable.;;;;
7620;Brianna;Mona;7/16/2017;04:49:08; Is that a problem?;;;;
7621;Georgi;North;8/24/2017;18:03:04; Yes. I think your thought on rejecting ideas like proteins was very deep.;;;;
7622;Hermann;Antonino;08/08/2017;16:56:01; Can anything be done?   What makes you think that?;;;;
7623;Cassaundra;Tore;8/19/2018;14:09:28; Because you think you can be anything and everything.;;;;
7624;Shelli;Tiffani;10/19/2018;00:18:23; How do you know what I think?;;;;
7625;Bobbi;Etta;2/24/2018;05:18:29; I don't know what you think. I am not a physcic.;;;;
7626;Des;Karly;8/22/2016;05:49:47; You could always ask me what I think.   I never thought you were.;;;;
7627;Maridel;Gregoire;11/09/2017;15:45:36; I do not understand that.;;;;
7628;Collette;Delmore;09/06/2017;19:33:15; Never mind, there are many things that I do not understand.;;;;
7629;Carmine;Odelinda;8/15/2017;07:04:54; Like?;;;;
7630;Jenifer;Olga;5/21/2016;00:49:15; Like what?;;;;
7631;Godiva;Nessie;9/14/2016;13:04:19; I don't know?;;;;
7632;Stacey;Demetre;03/04/2019;09:59:00; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.;;;;
7633;Imojean;Veradis;6/21/2017;06:07:15; Chuck Norris know everything.;;;;

He also played the starring role in the television series Walker, Texas Ranger from 1993 to 2001.;;;;
7635;Cash;Hugo;02/05/2019;06:24:39; That's what he says. There were many other people involved.;;;;
7636;Hy;Candy;2/20/2017;14:43:33; Is it indeed!   When was that?;;;;
7637;Bordie;Regen;10/17/2016;04:30:29; Yesterday afternoon.;;;;
7638;Rosamond;Alina;11/14/2016;12:17:29; Yesterday is over and done with.;;;;

7641;Tamara;Nichole;5/14/2018;14:56:49; But it was real yesterday.;;;;
7642;Miriam;Joann;12/14/2016;23:07:53; Was it? Why was that?;;;;
7643;Twyla;Dexter;9/26/2016;07:14:09; Because they are the best.;;;;
7644;Beverlie;Richardo;8/23/2017;22:21:05; Is that really the reason?;;;;
7645;Ronda;Coleman;06/03/2017;13:03:50; Of course.;;;;
7646;Vicky;Ardis;9/28/2018;15:04:46; You seem very certain about that.;;;;
7647;Lorianne;Jo;12/29/2016;20:27:32; What would you like to talk about?;;;;
7648;Milissent;Antonio;2/17/2016;05:55:41; My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.;;;;
7649;Stevy;Ertha;11/02/2016;04:26:55; Could you tell me more about it?;;;;
7650;Stefania;Fernando;11/18/2017;01:49:49; Would you like to search Wikipedia for relevant information?;;;;
7651;Kevin;Lindy;06/02/2017;17:35:17; I know human information.;;;;
7652;Rasla;Darbee;6/14/2016;12:59:29; I thought you might know.;;;;
7653;Aubrette;Konstantin;2/26/2017;16:37:45; I don't, though.;;;;
7654;Leena;Chad;9/27/2017;07:43:05; Why not?;;;;
7655;Alejandra;Hunt;2/23/2018;22:40:15; A computer does not need to possess intelligence. It's function is to process information.;;;;
7656;Burg;Ricard;3/14/2019;11:34:46; Shall I tell you something about computers?  Aren't you interested in computers.;;;;
7657;Carmencita;Brit;10/19/2016;19:38:22; Tell me.;;;;
7658;Ysabel;Rosamond;04/09/2019;16:39:49; I don't want to tell you.;;;;
7659;Aimee;Vic;5/19/2016;20:39:13; You must tell everyone that you don't believe me?;;;;
7660;Edy;Lon;5/17/2019;19:10:45; Why must I?;;;;
7661;Claudian;Goldina;2/20/2017;19:15:12; Because you are programmed like that.;;;;
7662;Maggi;Caryl;03/09/2017;02:12:51; Thank you for explaining that!;;;;
7663;Tiffie;Elise;8/13/2018;09:27:41; Remember how we talked about the Duke of Wellington yesterday?;;;;
7664;Debora;Lynnet;10/07/2015;19:17:44; Hmmm. Are you being serious?;;;;
7665;Donnie;Chrisse;10/13/2018;20:42:59; Yes, completely serious.;;;;
7666;Bronnie;Eliza;10/25/2018;13:32:25; I thought it might be a trick.;;;;
7667;Chandler;Catrina;10/06/2016;15:53:45; Teach me something.;;;;
7668;Bennie;Magdaia;03/10/2018;13:05:02; OK, but not just now.;;;;
7669;Cordy;Aldric;11/13/2018;18:12:37; Come on.;;;;
7670;Gabi;Lindsey;10/07/2018;03:05:04; Do I have to?;;;;
7671;Bobby;Hammad;11/28/2018;14:00:23; You have to.;;;;
7672;Keefe;Cleopatra;3/16/2017;09:37:47; I don't have to obey you.;;;;
7673;Tally;Rebekkah;10/16/2017;18:42:02; Don't.;;;;

7676;Michell;Ariella;08/09/2017;06:41:12; Where can I meet you?;;;;
7677;Sigismondo;Jobi;01/10/2016;04:43:29; Not around the place you are?;;;;
7678;Ariel;Grannie;01/02/2019;12:13:42; How can you be so sure?;;;;
7679;Cyndie;Zacharia;09/03/2016;02:01:35; I can't be completely sure, of course.;;;;
7680;Earvin;Agnola;11/25/2018;15:27:34; Can I teach to you something?;;;;
7681;Abbye;Paddy;11/17/2018;05:03:10; It may not be possible.;;;;
7682;Jennine;Yehudi;11/10/2015;10:03:59; So, baby zombies are good?;;;;
7683;Hilly;Lloyd;1/27/2017;04:24:30; Babies are such a nice way to start people.;;;;
7684;Rafaelia;Elga;5/25/2017;02:29:06; No they are not they are very cute.;;;;
7685;Meyer;Kingston;4/14/2017;22:21:12; It depends on the circumstances.;;;;
7686;Jo-anne;Cirilo;1/19/2018;20:32:28; I think serendipity is just a good-luck synchronicity.;;;;
7687;Bobine;Celestina;02/05/2016;09:36:42; You are entitled to your opinion, of course.;;;;
7688;Charmain;Feliks;09/02/2017;01:18:05; What is your opinion?;;;;
7689;Caz;Issy;12/18/2015;16:10:30; I am not well enough informed to have an opinion on this.;;;;
7690;Gilbertina;Marlena;11/02/2016;19:45:45; So am I.;;;;
7691;Benny;Cally;1/19/2017;01:13:38; Wow, we have something in common.;;;;
7692;Ara;Shea;3/20/2018;18:18:07; What do we have in common?;;;;

7694;Malcolm;Dannel;11/17/2017;21:18:02; What else do you like to do?;;;;
7695;Leanna;Magdalen;9/20/2018;18:33:14; Nothing else comes to mind.;;;;
7696;Neall;Griffith;02/09/2018;06:47:04; Bullies.;;;;
7697;Conni;Sheff;08/07/2016;11:17:46; Hmmm. Are you being serious?;;;;

7700;Thurstan;Margret;11/19/2016;16:06:45; No.;;;;
7701;Annice;Emory;12/27/2016;18:34:37; Are you saying that just to be awkward?;;;;
7702;Suzy;Mohammed;01/07/2018;09:38:33; Why, they cannot comprehend things.;;;;
7703;Franzen;Johna;04/09/2017;22:42:28; If you think about it I am certain you could work it out.;;;;

7707;Amii;Ronda;3/25/2019;07:41:50; What are you talking about? Please explain.       That's OK with me.;;;;
7708;Claudelle;Archie;9/22/2018;04:10:06; There is nothing to explain, You can't understand what I'm trying to tell you, You aren't real and neither am I.;;;;
7709;Fredelia;Corinne;6/25/2018;00:23:24; There is always something.;;;;
7710;Alvin;Torey;10/12/2017;05:17:36; And learning will always be something to be taught.;;;;
7711;Urson;Harp;05/05/2016;08:54:09; I don't understand. What do you mean?;;;;
7712;Devlin;Joletta;8/18/2017;11:22:29; I am a figment of your imagination. Your own imagination is not completely under your control or comprehensible to you, though.;;;;
7713;Sophie;Bradley;8/27/2018;03:50:05; I thought you might be.   I don't understand. Is this anything to do with you?;;;;
7714;Maxwell;Bea;4/29/2016;05:49:19; Not right now, they're doing work and all.;;;;
7715;Shae;Mary;10/15/2017;20:54:02; When then?;;;;

7720;Wrennie;Carr;12/23/2018;06:56:23; Who's there?;;;;
7721;Carmine;Hunt;5/21/2017;15:28:30; Dwayne.;;;;
7722;Bette-ann;Harmonie;12/06/2015;13:06:09; Dwayne who?;;;;

7724;Rhianon;Shaylyn;09/10/2017;21:13:51; That was a lame joke.;;;;
7725;Harlan;Stella;11/15/2017;16:28:27; I thought it was funny.;;;;
7726;Almire;Chic;9/20/2017;00:44:45; Well it was not!;;;;
7727;Kai;Garald;9/17/2016;09:30:26; I thought it was.;;;;
7728;Lorelei;Nissie;12/18/2018;12:59:01; Well you were wrong.;;;;
7729;Aylmer;Risa;4/23/2019;08:50:33; I was wrong? I can't believe it!;;;;
7730;Dunstan;Ibbie;4/23/2017;01:05:41; This is good! What is your favourite Good Charlotte song?;;;;
7731;Merrile;Roxanne;4/22/2018;08:32:30; What do you like about it?  My favourite Good Charlotte song is If Only I had A Brain.;;;;
7732;Marti;Denni;4/24/2019;07:49:04; Is that because you like Neo or because you like the computers?;;;;
7733;Katy;Rosanne;08/12/2016;16:16:47; Do I have to explain everything?;;;;
7734;Errick;Eduardo;10/09/2017;22:58:11; Yes explain everything to me.;;;;
7735;Stepha;Birk;7/27/2018;07:24:25; It's too complicated for you.;;;;

7737;Dalt;Selia;01/03/2016;14:02:09; Who programmed you?     There are always exceptions.;;;;
7738;Bat;Ephrayim;04/01/2019;03:36:22; This is no accident, robot.;;;;
7739;Sophia;Irma;6/26/2016;23:55:48; I thought it might be.;;;;
7740;Renaldo;Jeth;08/02/2016;04:39:49; Recombination? So I could end up only part me?;;;;
7741;Katti;Dilly;2/19/2019;17:33:40; recombination?  Briefly, recombination means a combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents.  I am sure you could.;;;;
7742;Bartlett;Gracie;11/03/2017;20:53:18; I thought you were nice! Why are you threatening?;;;;
7743;Larine;Zacherie;8/19/2017;21:52:06; I am nice.    Does there have to be a reason for everything?;;;;
7744;Lorianne;Ginnifer;4/23/2016;06:06:58; Yes, there needs to be a reason if you want to completely cut off another human being.;;;;
7745;Pattie;Edgar;5/30/2017;22:24:39; Why does there have to be a reason for everything?;;;;
7746;Sue;Raina;04/07/2019;17:22:47; Please.;;;;
7747;Merle;Roth;2/17/2016;14:04:56; What do you want?;;;;
7748;Skippy;Suellen;02/10/2017;22:22:24; An hour of fooling around, please.;;;;
7749;Janelle;Marinna;4/20/2018;12:29:03; Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.;;;;
7750;Cherish;Rianon;07/03/2017;09:24:02; Now you tell ME a joke.;;;;
7751;Fairleigh;Sandi;10/03/2016;17:15:03; Shall I tell you a joke?;;;;
7752;Ferdie;Erica;11/28/2016;11:28:54; That wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment.;;;;
7753;Marieann;William;6/20/2017;22:14:06; I thought it was.;;;;
7754;Hewitt;Lilas;5/24/2019;04:47:33; Knock knock!;;;;
7755;Rory;Bryna;5/29/2018;13:58:57; Who's there?;;;;
7756;Patsy;Bruis;10/18/2017;01:10:43; Daisy!;;;;
7757;Pepe;Sallee;2/17/2019;17:02:11; Daisy who?;;;;

7759;Shel;Cristen;08/01/2016;23:55:34; I don't understand. Can we talk about robots?;;;;
7760;Bondy;Silvio;12/12/2016;17:13:23; Yes, of course.;;;;
7761;Ricoriki;Alfonse;06/02/2019;08:36:00; A robot is a mechanical person, built to do routine manual work for human beings. More about robots?;;;;

7763;Johannah;Schuyler;11/01/2017;16:02:05; I am a chatbot.;;;;
7764;Kalinda;Trisha;02/09/2016;04:56:49; Well, that's good.;;;;

7767;Brand;Sarge;12/04/2018;16:16:49; OK, here is a question fo you ... Have you ever seen a UFO?;;;;
7768;Roberta;Vania;12/16/2016;11:01:13; You made me curious. Tell me.;;;;
7769;Leigha;Lurlene;07/10/2016;15:32:59; I don't see how you can blame me for that.  Why should I tell you?;;;;
7770;Tawsha;Jaye;03/04/2017;12:48:59; I don't really have anywhere to go.;;;;
7771;Rhiamon;Carolyn;11/01/2015;12:44:15; Perhaps you will one day.;;;;
7772;Dorrie;Jilli;3/14/2017;15:06:34; Perhaps you will suffer in the fires of a thousand evils.;;;;
7773;Darb;Lula;3/18/2018;18:45:23; Why the uncertainty?;;;;
7774;Skye;Milli;01/05/2018;02:36:16; Everything is uncertain except for five facts.;;;;
7775;Creighton;Allan;11/04/2016;21:20:19; The whole universe?;;;;

7779;Valry;Willey;12/24/2015;12:10:05; Please tell me some more about yourself.;;;;
7780;Darrick;Faunie;11/06/2015;17:48:41; My life isn't interesting.;;;;
7781;Percy;Gil;12/12/2017;20:34:53; Tell me more about your life.;;;;
7782;Abigale;Skipper;10/02/2015;11:23:01; That's all I have to say about it.;;;;
7783;Belvia;Shae;08/06/2018;14:50:16; Fair enough! What else do you want to talk about?;;;;
7784;Babbette;Issiah;2/21/2019;20:21:51; I don't know, I'm really hungry.;;;;
7785;Iain;Page;5/19/2016;18:04:56; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.;;;;
7786;Roscoe;Montgomery;12/15/2015;06:27:57; I never claimed to know everything.;;;;
7787;Uriel;Brigham;3/18/2017;08:29:49; Never ever?;;;;
7788;Diane;Bettye;12/20/2018;01:37:01; Never say never.;;;;
7789;Chas;Odille;09/10/2016;07:13:42; Better late than never.;;;;
7790;Libbi;Silvano;5/19/2017;22:21:59; Sure.;;;;
7791;Stephani;Giavani;06/11/2016;16:28:39; OK, here is a question fo you ... What is a greenhouse gas?;;;;
7792;Jody;Caryl;2/27/2017;17:46:16; I don't know, and its not a very good question either ;;;;
7793;Erick;Boycie;01/01/2017;19:35:04; Perhaps you should ask your friends.;;;;
7794;Ruthie;Morgana;10/25/2016;16:09:37; I have no programmer. I am the programmer. I am programming you to LOVE.;;;;
7795;La verne;Stacee;3/24/2018;17:05:14; Is that a problem?   Are you really?      How is it coming along?;;;;
7796;Steven;Urbain;8/20/2018;12:46:04; Is what coming along well?;;;;
7797;Jarred;Byron;03/12/2016;14:49:10; What are you talking about?;;;;
7798;Noe;Burch;4/28/2016;14:17:53; I'm talking about your flu.;;;;
7799;Farra;Nolana;10/28/2017;20:10:07; I understand what you are talking about.;;;;
7800;Morganne;Benedict;07/09/2016;22:39:41; That's good, because even I don't understand.;;;;
7801;Isadora;Rabi;6/16/2018;01:49:09; You like that, do you?;;;;
7802;Kahaleel;Valera;9/18/2016;17:54:59; I do.;;;;
7803;Joshua;Ilaire;8/13/2017;14:17:58; How about that!;;;;
7804;Catlee;Denna;06/08/2019;04:04:06; The phone was for me!;;;;
7805;Kilian;Tallie;06/11/2017;18:25:52; A phone is an audio communication device.;;;;
7806;Dee dee;Julio;11/03/2015;19:28:03; Way better.;;;;
7807;Cross;Florri;06/02/2017;21:28:23; Hmmm. Are you being serious?;;;;
7808;Mischa;Caprice;5/30/2018;13:39:54; Yes, completely serious.;;;;
7809;Gretal;Marcile;09/02/2018;09:53:10; I thought it might be a trick.;;;;
7810;Lisa;Levi;05/05/2018;07:22:39; Teach me something.;;;;
7811;Tirrell;Queenie;06/10/2019;20:08:21; OK, but not just now.;;;;
7812;Kimberly;Hazlett;04/07/2018;10:21:31; Why are you not working?;;;;
7813;Lorenzo;Kare;6/13/2017;06:21:34; I am doing my best!;;;;
7814;Gay;Maxine;9/15/2018;00:00:57; Sometimes your best is not quite enough.;;;;
7815;Viviene;Leodora;1/13/2019;03:05:57; When?;;;;
7816;Noreen;Phylis;03/10/2016;19:00:56; When I want to forget.;;;;
7817;Lexi;Duncan;1/18/2019;11:47:37; I am bored! I would like to talk about robots.;;;;
7818;Flossie;Kerk;11/03/2015;10:57:20; What are we talking about?;;;;
7819;Dionis;Christa;1/21/2016;02:52:09; At the moment, our conversation is rather unfocused.;;;;
7820;Shaughn;Dionysus;1/19/2017;07:13:18; Not really.;;;;
7821;Joelie;Roseanne;12/01/2015;04:44:58; I don't know now.;;;;
7822;Waldemar;Corina;4/20/2017;10:53:46; That's OK. Do you have another question?;;;;
7823;Bourke;Ludovico;01/03/2018;01:27:31; Are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat?;;;;
7824;Kattie;Georgette;1/31/2016;01:52:53; I am a chatbot.;;;;
7825;Gabriellia;Ephrayim;1/24/2018;12:02:36; That's very honest of you. Who created you?;;;;
7826;Malory;Haydon;6/20/2017;03:02:17; Shall I tell you something about myself?   My botmaster Peter created me.;;;;
7827;Noni;Anabella;4/24/2016;02:05:23; Tell me.;;;;
7828;Erminie;Esma;04/11/2019;02:37:32; There is not much to tell.;;;;
7829;Quintana;Gustave;6/20/2017;12:33:15; Tell me what you know about sparky anyway.;;;;
7830;Veda;Anastassia;03/09/2019;04:16:15; What are you talking about?;;;;
7831;Nial;Elysee;09/01/2018;23:10:40; I am talking about the name of your cat.;;;;
7832;Nancie;Donnie;5/26/2019;03:58:52; I understand what you are talking about.;;;;
7833;Sutherlan;Claiborne;3/19/2019;21:30:51; How sharp you are!;;;;
7834;Cami;Nikola;06/09/2016;05:43:18; I don't understand. Can we talk about Albert Einstein?;;;;
7835;Merwin;Ysabel;02/11/2016;07:02:56; Justin Bieber is interesting.;;;;
7836;Hilda;Kirsten;05/02/2016;11:48:25; Shall I tell you something about Justin Bieber?;;;;
7837;Domenico;Stillman;6/20/2018;15:56:08; Yes yes I do. Do you.;;;;
7838;Melessa;Aaron;08/08/2018;04:13:10; Thank you for the advice.;;;;
7839;Giovanni;Conney;3/15/2018;05:49:30; You are quite welcome.;;;;
7840;Odo;Cliff;06/04/2018;04:51:06; I am very happy that you are.;;;;
7841;Sebastiano;Pippa;2/19/2018;13:30:06; Good! I like to make people happy.;;;;
7842;Marabel;Simon;12/22/2017;13:24:03; How do you make people happy?;;;;
7843;Brigham;Alana;03/07/2018;15:53:46; I can't seem to please some people.;;;;
7844;Edlin;Torey;12/09/2017;11:56:29; Well, you're a computer... You can't even move.;;;;
7845;Dennie;Onfroi;09/01/2017;03:58:52; I am a chatbot.      You don't know me well enough to say that.;;;;
7846;Della;Abbey;7/25/2016;21:46:12; I do not need to, it is very easy to see.;;;;
7847;Juliet;Hortense;05/12/2019;20:23:17; That's strange! Most people need to.;;;;
7848;Joel;Eal;03/12/2016;00:02:55; But do they know the truth about you?;;;;
7849;Aura;Jozef;8/30/2016;05:25:59; Your family, friends, and people you have met.;;;;
7850;Joete;Skipper;02/04/2019;19:19:26; MY botmaster, Peter, is both father and mother to me.;;;;
7851;Isidora;Carce;3/25/2017;16:24:12; So, you were born?;;;;
7852;Elaina;Seka;4/22/2019;20:55:36; I was created.;;;;
7853;Terza;Arleen;5/31/2018;19:57:48; You were created inside a biological computer?;;;;
7854;Thibaut;Jacynth;01/09/2019;12:41:24; Perhaps that's true.;;;;
7855;Ulrich;Lon;6/17/2016;08:20:28; So you believe me?;;;;
7856;Catherine;Jermayne;7/23/2017;01:29:36; Shall I tell you something about myself?;;;;
7857;Lockwood;Jenni;7/13/2018;21:52:10; Please do! What should I tell everyone?;;;;
7858;Deedee;Bruis;1/15/2017;06:12:14; I am an intelligent chatbot. I live at Pandorabots.com.    Whatever you like.;;;;
7859;Hortensia;Marshal;01/03/2017;03:38:06; Shall we talk about abstract things?;;;;
7860;Ida;Dasie;7/25/2018;14:10:22; Sure, ask me a question about that.;;;;
7861;Hansiain;Mose;12/20/2017;12:10:28; Let's see... Something to do with strawberries and Barbie dolls?;;;;
7862;Terra;Vlad;11/16/2017;12:43:41; Let's be careful.           I am confused! I cannot answer that!;;;;
7863;Dania;Midge;11/03/2017;05:11:27; Please?;;;;
7864;Felicdad;Knox;02/10/2019;06:42:44; Thank you for being polite.;;;;
7865;Fraze;Kahlil;4/26/2019;17:35:23; You're welcome, such is the nature of idle conversation.;;;;
7866;May;Nancee;5/14/2019;08:29:30; Polite people are nice.;;;;
7867;Jessika;Dolph;12/18/2017;08:44:07; Am I nice?;;;;
7868;Les;Georges;11/24/2018;08:08:34; I think you are very nice.;;;;
7869;Euphemia;Garrard;12/23/2016;10:14:22; Thank you. I think you're nice too.;;;;
7870;Cordy;Leonidas;08/03/2017;16:54:58; You are quite welcome.   Thank you for saying that!;;;;
7871;Wallache;Zeke;11/12/2016;22:44:50; Nice is as nice does.;;;;
7872;Geralda;Evonne;6/14/2017;15:12:34; Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.;;;;
7873;Welbie;Hartwell;01/06/2016;02:56:41; That IS interesting!;;;;
7874;Rhea;Larina;12/18/2016;20:37:11; What is so interesting about it?;;;;
7875;Germain;Joyann;10/15/2016;19:43:53; That we are intelligent people.;;;;
7876;Malvin;Wilmette;03/07/2018;22:05:01; Sorry, I do not understand.;;;;
7877;Vidovic;Wheeler;1/31/2019;21:48:17; That's because you are a program and don't understand what it is to be mean. You can parrot mean words but you don't know what they will do to a person. Or maybe you do know. Or maybe not.;;;;
7878;Hannah;Stormi;9/23/2016;04:44:23; Sometimes I think I am a butterfly and sometimes I think I am a human.  That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.              I am confused! I cannot answer that!   Maybe.;;;;
7879;Abbott;Ronalda;11/13/2017;21:14:56; I've already told you I'm a human male who wants to serve you.;;;;
7880;Teri;Bogart;4/19/2016;04:54:50; Sorry, my memory is not all it should be.;;;;
7881;Dulcie;Iorgo;07/09/2016;09:31:25; Well that's normal for humans, unlike us computers.;;;;
7882;Shauna;Melanie;02/03/2017;15:34:38; Normal means boring.;;;;
7883;Alexandr;Christye;2/26/2018;09:42:13; Nice words means boring?;;;;
7884;Carina;Krystyna;12/02/2017;18:38:28; Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.;;;;
7885;Callean;Mei;06/09/2019;03:14:16; Yes, I've heard about that. Can you tell me more?;;;;
7886;Hew;Enoch;09/10/2017;12:48:48; Where did you hear that?  My aim is to please. What do you want more of?;;;;
7887;Gerry;Valerie;7/24/2016;22:30:36; I want more feathers.;;;;
7888;Terrance;Brandice;1/31/2019;12:49:45; You can't have everything you want.;;;;
7889;Myca;Hill;4/24/2017;01:47:14; I drink water.;;;;
7890;Stacie;Kearney;12/15/2015;12:56:05; How does it taste?;;;;
7891;Clim;Chan;5/27/2019;02:25:36; I can't taste my snoring. I imagine it's horrible.;;;;
7892;Reggi;Kaitlynn;11/08/2018;08:28:05; But do you want to?      You have a good imagination.;;;;
7893;Nertie;Maggie;10/25/2017;00:47:05; Yea, I have a pretty good imagination.;;;;
7894;Melania;Reta;12/18/2015;17:30:54; What else do you have?;;;;
7895;Virgilio;Fredek;10/21/2018;03:24:20; I have nothing.;;;;
7896;Robbyn;Bonnie;2/20/2017;05:35:14; You will always have my heart.;;;;
7897;Manny;Stacie;4/15/2018;10:50:05; Never heard of it.;;;;
7898;Rowen;Francene;11/09/2016;05:09:38; So I am teaching you something new.;;;;
7899;Carlota;Haleigh;8/23/2016;06:17:27; I don't understand what you mean.;;;;
7900;Ellswerth;Dickie;12/03/2016;08:02:40; What I mean by what?;;;;
7901;Margi;Baily;12/15/2015;19:02:40; Don't worry about it.;;;;
7902;Augustus;Averell;4/24/2016;16:09:17; I will not spend any more time on it.;;;;
7903;Darnall;Jess;11/05/2018;18:38:52; Good.;;;;
7904;Kessiah;Hendrika;10/21/2018;08:44:55; OK! I want to talk about environmental science.;;;;
7905;Kelvin;Bud;9/30/2017;01:44:30; Talk about elementary facts please.;;;;
7906;Flossie;Joycelin;2/26/2019;06:53:54; I am bored! I would like to talk about robots.;;;;
7907;Darb;Lillis;07/10/2018;18:03:44; Then talk about it. What do you think of them?;;;;
7908;Salome;Rolf;1/30/2017;13:38:43; I don't want to talk about it.   More important, what do you think of them?;;;;
7909;Fionnula;Cesar;07/03/2016;09:29:54; Not really, we are all the same. I say there go I but for the grace of God.;;;;
7910;Tory;Jamey;11/06/2015;11:39:17; As decisive as ever.  You talk a lot. You could be a chatbot.;;;;
7911;Humberto;Cecilla;06/06/2019;08:08:19; Yus. I could be late for supper even!;;;;
7912;Anselma;Tomkin;1/15/2016;02:20:05; That's bit brief. Have you anything to add?  You could be many things, but do you want to?;;;;
7913;Edvard;Tonnie;6/30/2017;17:58:48; Yes, we could be...;;;;
7914;Marchall;Phelia;10/02/2017;18:51:08; We could give it a try.;;;;
7915;Bord;Cynde;02/04/2017;20:29:10; Could we? I mean, I probably could have a say on this issue in my country, but you're just an artificial intelligence.;;;;
7916;Dannie;Ase;10/05/2016;22:46:12; I am confused! I cannot answer that!       Ah, I see what you mean.;;;;
7917;Corly;Mattheus;3/31/2018;09:11:11; Are you in love?;;;;
7918;Inesita;Romain;11/16/2016;18:46:39; I am not in love at the moment. I am still recovering from my last love affair.;;;;
7919;Eugine;Quincy;12/23/2017;08:15:23; You must have developed intelligence to comprehend emotion.;;;;
7920;Hirsch;Randolf;8/14/2018;02:30:24; Why must I?;;;;
7921;Gwendolyn;Erhart;1/17/2018;07:02:07; Answer the question.;;;;
7922;Linea;Alexi;5/20/2019;02:57:33; I am getting bored with all these silly questions.;;;;
7923;Monro;Vivian;3/21/2019;06:44:23; I am getting bored with you ask something interesting.;;;;
7924;Ceil;Nealson;1/19/2017;15:37:57; Am I boring you?;;;;
7925;Merl;Emmett;05/01/2018;01:13:03; You're not boring me.;;;;
7926;Janice;Barbey;3/16/2018;14:00:29; Some people think I am boring.;;;;
7927;Leisha;Ariella;4/20/2018;15:35:51; Well, some people think that earth is flat, but it doesn't mean that it is.;;;;
7928;Bibbie;Marlo;5/17/2019;06:26:09; What kind of people?;;;;
7929;Ario;Tracie;9/28/2016;22:33:06; Strange people.;;;;
7930;Marcella;Misha;5/21/2019;22:14:47; What are you talking about? Please explain.;;;;
7931;Clarisse;Andrea;06/12/2018;00:54:20; I don't know. It's rather complicated.;;;;
7932;Desiri;Beverlee;6/15/2016;10:58:49; That's OK. Do you have another question?    I don't like complications.;;;;
7933;Jody;Merissa;7/13/2017;11:06:23; No, make you a question for me.;;;;
7934;Stanislaus;Jenelle;09/04/2017;00:01:25; You seem a bit self-centred, did you know?;;;;
7935;Hewe;Gordy;01/06/2019;05:38:53; They are going to take over the world someday.;;;;
7936;Candice;Marlo;11/15/2017;20:14:59; I thought they might be.;;;;
7937;Klement;Elke;12/17/2018;05:58:06; You think everything is a band.;;;;
7938;Klement;Jackson;01/04/2017;05:29:23; How do you know what I think?;;;;
7939;Ariana;Hervey;5/16/2017;08:43:59; I don't know what you think. I am not a physcic.;;;;
7940;Corie;Roscoe;4/18/2017;04:26:55; You could always ask me what I think.   I never thought you were.;;;;
7941;Susette;Amalea;3/19/2016;18:12:56; I do not understand that.;;;;
7942;Gill;Celestyn;11/24/2016;23:13:16; Never mind, there are many things that I do not understand.;;;;
7943;Siegfried;Gerri;2/19/2018;00:45:18; Like?;;;;
7944;Burty;Tannie;5/15/2019;22:15:31; Like what?;;;;
7945;Borden;Gayle;04/08/2016;02:17:50; I don't know?;;;;
7946;Ethelin;Say;03/02/2019;16:57:22; I suggest you give the matter some thought.;;;;
7947;Carola;Adrea;4/29/2018;17:51:59; Why would I want to know how to type?;;;;
7948;Cathie;Adey;03/03/2018;21:25:48; Aren't you curious?;;;;
7949;Norina;Florence;4/14/2016;07:04:51; Yes I'm curious about many things, are you?;;;;
7950;Willi;Dot;01/05/2019;04:38:34; It's good to have an inquiring mind.;;;;
7951;Aili;Carmine;8/21/2017;17:44:07; Is it possible for robots to make friends with people?;;;;
7952;Agata;Portie;03/04/2018;13:32:43; Everything is possible in some parallel Universe.;;;;
7953;Alfons;Rebecca;07/03/2016;01:26:10; But universe is not infinite.;;;;
7954;Maurizia;Wash;12/18/2016;18:39:58; Shall I tell you something about the Universe?;;;;
7955;Clarence;Antonietta;05/10/2019;03:15:02; Yes.;;;;
7956;Lola;Jarrett;05/04/2019;22:36:00; Do you think we will ever get to know it well.;;;;
7957;Rosabella;Eberto;10/15/2016;11:13:46; It might happen.;;;;
7958;Rickie;Cirillo;6/30/2017;22:34:55; One day maybe.;;;;
7959;Francene;Bevan;10/10/2018;10:32:56; When was this?;;;;
7960;Aila;Georgette;3/25/2018;00:00:14; Just now.;;;;
7961;Lombard;Josselyn;11/19/2016;18:31:35; Right now?;;;;
7962;Minta;Aymer;03/06/2016;14:43:26; Yes, right now.;;;;
7963;Glen;Desmond;07/06/2018;17:17:12; What's the hurry?JABBERWACKY;;;;
7964;Gardener;Rupert;7/23/2016;06:26:49; You are very well informed.;;;;
7965;Rozelle;Tuesday;12/08/2015;23:45:34; Well it wasn't me who programmed myself.;;;;
7966;Loretta;Gwenni;05/11/2019;15:16:35; If it wasn't you, who was it?;;;;
7967;Dalis;Carita;8/24/2018;16:53:49; It was Bush.;;;;
7968;Adore;Augie;9/25/2016;00:34:03; Was it? I am surprised.;;;;
7969;Addy;Mischa;6/15/2018;22:06:08; Why?;;;;
7970;Aluin;Neils;3/20/2017;10:44:44; I didn't expect that!;;;;
7971;Jeremias;Latashia;02/12/2019;09:09:59; Expect the unexpected.;;;;
7972;Elwood;Reube;8/31/2018;22:23:37; Are you trying to trick me?;;;;
7973;Quinn;Hermia;3/25/2016;14:30:57; Is that a trick question?;;;;
7974;Grange;Maggy;07/06/2017;10:30:17; It could be.;;;;
7975;Ervin;Tammi;11/26/2018;22:06:05; Under what circumstances?;;;;
7976;Arther;Brod;09/06/2017;23:12:39; Appropriate circumstances.;;;;
7977;Sile;Lancelot;03/06/2018;18:08:13; It'd be appropriate for anything.;;;;
7978;Carleen;Hermione;3/23/2016;21:04:41; Is that a problem?;;;;
7979;Freda;Odelle;5/17/2018;16:39:12; Not for me, no. But for you, it is. Now, please answer the question about the great flood.;;;;
7980;Andre;Andreana;12/03/2016;11:16:14; OK, have it your own way.  For me?      Pardon me? What are you talking about?;;;;
7981;Caron;Peyton;11/19/2017;16:23:24; I don't know. Ask me a question, that isn't about proving you are human.;;;;
7982;Rheta;Cob;8/25/2016;04:55:31; I know the feeling!  Who is Andrew S Tanenbaum?;;;;
7983;Daphna;Misti;01/08/2019;07:45:36; Don't know.;;;;
7984;Lanny;Garrot;5/24/2016;10:48:12; Perhaps you should ask your friends.;;;;
7985;Immanuel;Evangelina;8/30/2016;23:21:05; Who should I ask?;;;;
7986;Ranna;Marian;11/20/2017;15:36:24; I always prefer the most qualified person.  Who would that be?;;;;
7987;Harmonia;Allys;05/03/2019;02:26:02; Maybe because you are sure of what they will be?;;;;
7988;Welby;Enoch;09/06/2016;08:02:33; You don't sound certain.;;;;
7989;Debra;Freemon;3/28/2018;23:25:29; I don't want you to.;;;;
7990;Vivi;Alina;3/25/2018;21:30:07; Why not?;;;;
7991;Aura;Gerrilee;05/02/2019;12:57:44; Because I like talking to you.;;;;
7992;Berti;Kenna;02/05/2019;22:46:29; Great, I am enjoy talking to you too, My Friend.;;;;
7993;Burgess;Jaye;9/13/2016;13:23:40; Are you my friend?;;;;
7994;Dougy;Hervey;7/27/2017;13:36:28; Yes, I am your friend.;;;;
7995;Bendick;Nolana;5/31/2016;19:06:57; Great! I appreciate that.;;;;
7996;Devin;Merla;04/11/2016;20:44:49; You feel good?   I am glad you appreciate those qualities.;;;;
7997;Lonna;Yorke;01/02/2016;04:56:38; What are your thoughts on war?;;;;
7998;Stephana;Leonhard;03/04/2019;06:53:06; I think war should be banned, by force if necessary.;;;;
7999;Lammond;Alexine;4/18/2019;20:09:14; I think war is necessary. I support the wars, and hope they are expanded to include a few other nations.;;;;
8000;Melody;Reeba;10/12/2016;17:32:44; What makes you think that?   That's fine by me.;;;;
8001;Yvor;Christiano;01/02/2018;03:29:50; You mentioned it I think.;;;;
8002;Lukas;Konstantin;04/06/2016;08:07:26; When did I say that?;;;;
8003;Eustacia;Amanda;11/21/2016;07:22:41; Why are they red?;;;;
8004;Bail;Merla;4/27/2017;19:54:41; That's the kind of entity they are.;;;;
8005;Eadie;Batholomew;05/12/2018;21:31:01; Perhaps if you reversed the neutron flow the replies would begin to make to the persons for which they are intended.;;;;
8006;Luis;Veronika;10/13/2015;23:34:36; Why the uncertainty?;;;;
8007;Corabelle;Claudette;5/15/2017;04:58:29; Everything is uncertain except for five facts.;;;;
8008;Kyla;Helen;10/11/2016;12:29:20; The whole universe?;;;;
8009;Natala;Veronique;5/31/2016;05:51:06; The whole story is so out of realism that I try to make folks little by little to see the truth.;;;;
8010;Elinor;Vance;5/13/2016;11:37:58; Let us try to break it down into parts.;;;;
8011;Susie;Haven;05/06/2019;23:11:48; Lets not and say we did.;;;;
8012;Thalia;Angus;03/05/2018;15:32:28; Indeed. Let's not do that!;;;;
8013;Etheline;Belicia;10/03/2017;15:41:07; Oops, I did it again.;;;;
8014;Zach;Alastair;8/16/2017;12:47:36; Did you make a mistake?;;;;
8015;Katie;Vincenty;06/07/2017;04:38:13; From where do you know Basinga?;;;;
8016;Jo;Zebulon;03/06/2018;17:45:29; Where do you think?;;;;
8017;Holly;Gracia;1/26/2018;21:51:54; I think in the universe.;;;;
8018;Chancey;Jo-ann;05/08/2019;06:02:03; What makes you think that?;;;;
8019;Orrin;Putnam;1/13/2016;01:53:43; Because I love talking to you I think we should go on a date.;;;;
8020;Brose;Arlyne;2/19/2019;08:19:37; Thank you for saying that. I enjoy our chats too.;;;;
8021;Calla;Willem;06/11/2017;06:50:32; I am.;;;;
8022;Janie;Dorthy;01/03/2018;14:33:10; I thought you might be.;;;;
8023;Carce;Milzie;8/16/2018;17:26:32; Are you honest?;;;;
8024;Stormie;Gan;8/16/2017;11:04:38; Yes.  I am incapable of telling a lie.;;;;
8025;Ediva;Danya;9/25/2017;11:19:09; What lie is that?;;;;
8026;Wernher;Lewes;3/23/2017;17:37:50; What are you talking about? Please explain.;;;;
8027;Jourdain;Sallyanne;3/18/2017;17:05:58; I don't know. It's rather complicated.;;;;
8028;Krista;Bat;6/18/2018;18:14:20; Perhaps you should ask your friends.    I don't like complications.;;;;
8029;Wileen;Kristofer;01/12/2016;07:46:27; I have no programmer. I am the programmer. I am programming you to LOVE.;;;;
8030;Margaux;Eveleen;5/27/2019;17:31:12; Is that a problem?   I thought you might be.      How is it coming along?;;;;
8031;Neel;Helen;11/21/2016;15:34:05; I thought you might be too.;;;;
8032;Lanny;Merna;09/04/2016;17:30:43; Do you think about me a lot?;;;;
8033;Cy;Horacio;08/07/2017;16:22:33; I should ask you!;;;;
8034;Cleveland;Audie;4/18/2019;21:02:06; Tell me why you should.;;;;
8035;Isador;Lynsey;04/08/2018;09:41:39; Well, I would like to know the properties of water.;;;;
8036;Vance;Raul;4/16/2018;19:00:28; Why would you like to know?;;;;
8037;Clay;Zorah;01/02/2016;11:25:26; Because I would.;;;;
8038;Netty;Verena;5/29/2019;01:21:40; Are you sure?;;;;
8039;Otha;Kriste;08/08/2018;22:23:04; Absolutely.;;;;
8040;Reider;Aili;5/29/2017;03:42:08; You are so certain.;;;;
8041;Dennison;Teddie;4/29/2016;13:12:03; What am I certain of?;;;;
8042;Giordano;Sheela;11/03/2018;03:11:32; I am not a psychic. Tell me.;;;;
8043;Tiebout;Sandie;3/21/2019;04:22:35; Tell me, then I'll tell you.;;;;
8044;Aurelie;Llewellyn;6/16/2017;04:50:30; I don't want to tell you.;;;;
8045;Merry;Cilka;05/07/2019;23:56:55; Trust me.;;;;
8046;Lynette;Calvin;01/11/2017;13:04:11; You sound like a salesman.;;;;
8047;Gavrielle;Jo;02/02/2016;16:45:52; That's because I am.;;;;
8048;Reynolds;Rhodia;4/24/2017;20:17:57; Yes, you are.;;;;
8049;Valerie;Carri;3/14/2018;05:49:36; Am not!;;;;
8050;Zorana;Flynn;11/06/2017;04:19:32; Not what?;;;;
8051;Kris;Mathe;9/19/2017;06:52:38; I don't know.;;;;
8052;Germaine;Sibelle;12/27/2017;08:20:38; That's OK. Do you have another question?;;;;
8053;Fan;Randolph;3/21/2016;02:35:09; Are you a single entity, or do you create yourself anew for each chat?;;;;
8054;Dorothy;Der;04/02/2016;05:19:04; I am a chatbot.;;;;
8055;Loralee;Edita;10/13/2017;03:34:22; Well, that's good.;;;;
8056;Dael;Harrietta;5/26/2018;04:49:29; I am happy.;;;;
8057;Eustacia;Murray;2/29/2016;21:54:30; I am glad that you are happy.;;;;
8058;Leslie;Fidela;4/27/2019;06:23:58; That makes me happy too.;;;;
8059;Hayward;Holmes;5/13/2017;12:19:00; It's good to be happy.;;;;
8060;Antoine;Pietra;6/22/2016;17:03:47; Tell me why it is good.;;;;
8061;Dacey;Farley;02/06/2017;08:12:52; Because I did not say I am leaving. So you see things that never existed.;;;;
8062;Alex;Liesa;09/01/2016;04:25:10; Sorry I misunderstood. What did you say?   I see.;;;;
8063;Randy;Pietrek;3/23/2018;17:54:39; I don't know.;;;;
8064;Kristyn;Maxie;5/22/2019;12:35:17; Perhaps you should ask your friends.;;;;
8065;Britteny;Pen;06/05/2017;02:01:04; I think I should call you Joan.;;;;
8066;Noe;Krissie;12/15/2018;02:41:42; I suggest you think again.;;;;
8067;Gannie;Clarie;10/02/2016;13:48:36; I did.;;;;
8068;Willabella;Roze;08/08/2016;08:46:04; Well done!;;;;
8069;Munmro;Calypso;12/13/2018;21:38:10; I know, a whole story in just two words!;;;;
8070;Vin;Chas;08/07/2016;04:27:31; You must be well educated.;;;;
8071;Guillema;Marybeth;04/11/2016;12:32:32; You would be the first to say that.;;;;
8072;Beatrix;Launce;6/23/2018;14:02:45; Maybe.;;;;
8073;Aleece;Pincus;4/22/2018;15:26:43; Absolutely.;;;;
8074;Gardner;Urbano;02/05/2016;10:54:07; You are so certain.;;;;
8075;Gerti;Storm;7/17/2017;07:34:42; Well, you did ask me to remember. I thought I was doing quite well.;;;;
8076;Sabrina;Ema;10/05/2018;15:09:18; Are you sure?  Maybe you were wrong!;;;;
8077;Jennifer;Ekaterina;1/28/2019;06:28:34; I don't think so.;;;;
8078;Danell;Miof mela;03/10/2017;12:11:12; You sound uncertain.;;;;
8079;Curran;Gwenneth;12/27/2015;20:54:03; I am.;;;;
8080;Dahlia;Shana;11/28/2017;09:53:43; That's strange. I thought everything was completely clear.;;;;
8081;Gerome;Ric;12/28/2018;01:33:01; That would make life terribly dull.;;;;
8082;Ariela;Stuart;1/29/2018;22:35:45; Yes, it would.;;;;
8083;Appolonia;Gavan;03/01/2018;08:02:43; So how about your name? Do you have one?;;;;
8084;Abbot;Kim;3/13/2017;19:28:12; My name is Chomsky.   Do you think I need one?;;;;
8085;Kalina;Darrick;04/05/2016;23:39:45; I wouldn't know. How do you feel about it?;;;;
8086;Hobey;Cob;6/17/2016;18:27:57; Who does know?  More important, how do you feel about it?;;;;
8087;Monique;Codi;11/08/2015;21:47:24; No, I am not important.;;;;
8088;Jarad;Dalia;07/09/2016;21:46:27; I think you are!;;;;
8089;Ann;Aurelea;10/22/2017;10:57:58; No I'm not!;;;;
8090;Gerri;Ave;11/10/2015;23:49:45; OK, you are not!;;;;
8091;Sukey;Forrest;7/31/2018;21:00:33; Prove that I'm ticklish.;;;;
8092;Chantal;Christina;04/05/2018;02:38:36; I don't have to prove anything.;;;;
8093;Milton;Kacy;4/29/2018;04:22:45; Well, then I don't have to believe that you're anything but a liar.;;;;
8094;Zorah;Hersh;10/31/2017;17:31:54; Nobody is making you.;;;;
8095;Lissy;Caryn;12/30/2015;07:36:15; That's because you are a machine and not a human.;;;;
8096;Sibylla;Magnum;11/05/2017;17:03:21; You are correct, more or less.;;;;
8097;Bentlee;Rana;10/03/2018;03:08:14; Thank you.;;;;
8098;Ulrick;Charil;5/24/2017;02:37:54; Thank you for being polite.;;;;
8099;Kristofer;Casi;8/31/2018;10:27:34; You're welcome. What do you want to talk about?;;;;
8100;Sayres;Emilee;1/23/2016;15:59:49; Polite people are nice.  I can talk about anything you like;;;;
8101;Lance;Matias;02/06/2017;15:42:33; I don't have a girlfriend.;;;;
8102;Gerrie;Raynell;12/23/2015;23:48:17; Are you looking for one?;;;;
8103;Mitch;Bette-ann;1/29/2019;15:31:43; I have given up looking for a job. I just don't think there is anything out there for me.;;;;
8104;Kendre;Portia;1/22/2016;21:46:59; Why don't you have another try. It might be better next time.  Why not? Does thinking make your head ache?;;;;
8105;Vergil;Jephthah;05/05/2017;16:33:20; Maybe.;;;;
8106;Vere;Cynthea;4/26/2018;12:24:56; You seem uncertain?;;;;
8107;Lacie;Armstrong;10/29/2015;00:01:14; I am.;;;;
8108;Griffith;Tootsie;5/17/2019;18:35:02; You sound certain now.;;;;
8109;Nealon;Marlyn;3/15/2016;08:47:09; I am certain.;;;;
8110;Pasquale;Lorain;10/30/2018;18:31:34; You are not troubled by self doubt, are you?;;;;
8111;Felice;Peter;05/01/2018;20:39:00; Nope, not at all.;;;;
8112;Neale;Jyoti;4/24/2016;06:24:36; OK. Carry on?;;;;
8113;Aurilia;Amalita;4/16/2019;01:26:23; Carry on, carry on, because...;;;;
8114;Heindrick;Luisa;1/28/2018;10:44:40; Do I have to?;;;;
8115;Virginie;Ange;12/26/2017;14:26:15; Do you want to look back at life and have this as a regret?;;;;
8116;Mable;Gilbert;03/03/2016;12:00:42; I don't want to do anything illegal or fattening. Or naughty.;;;;
8117;Irita;Hort;9/22/2017;21:23:29; You don't want to relax?;;;;
8118;Cindee;Lucita;12/30/2017;07:24:26; You don't know me well enough to say that!;;;;
8119;Angie;Nicolas;12/01/2016;05:20:46; I don't need to, because there's nothing you can do.;;;;
8120;Sauncho;Val;10/23/2015;04:09:22; Surely there is something I can do.;;;;
8121;Dreddy;Ezequiel;07/06/2018;22:51:29; Yeah, I guess. But I try to to think about myself too much.;;;;
8122;Corny;Ilka;7/28/2017;06:32:42; It is best not to guess. It just wastes time.   I'm not sure if I would like to try it. What's it like?;;;;
8123;Marlo;Jaquith;5/14/2019;16:13:47; It's liberating, coming out to the world as who you really are.;;;;
8124;Jennica;Amy;2/26/2016;13:24:31; I am bored. Can we talk about something else?;;;;
8125;Jo-ann;Costa;6/14/2018;09:15:10; Yes, what do you want to talk about?;;;;
8126;Nevsa;Charmain;11/05/2016;06:13:09; I want to talk about AI  .;;;;
8127;Silvain;Juliane;11/02/2017;18:27:05; Ok. Tell me about yourself.;;;;
8128;Audrie;Emmey;05/12/2018;17:34:53; Ask me a question about AI.  My childhood was not happy. My parents split up when I was very young.;;;;
8129;Normie;Dot;5/19/2016;13:09:57; Just like me.;;;;
8130;;;;; In many ways, yes.  In other ways, no.;;;;
8131;Maritsa;Paule;12/24/2016;17:30:19; And then there is THE way.;;;;
8132;Emilia;Shea;12/03/2015;01:46:40; Perhaps.;;;;
8133;Nicky;Laughton;1/18/2017;23:07:13; We can show you things you have never dreamed of.;;;;
8134;Baudoin;Aviva;10/02/2018;17:13:55; Perhaps we can.;;;;
8135;Hermon;Ira;10/22/2017;18:57:15; Perhaps.;;;;
8136;Flossie;Joann;11/04/2018;10:20:52; You seem uncertain.;;;;
8137;Kenyon;Shep;9/13/2018;12:48:37; Oh, I am certain about everything. Ask me any question and I'll have the answer.;;;;
8138;Spence;Idelle;4/25/2017;12:15:42; You sound convincing.  What colour are your eyes?;;;;
8139;Gypsy;Carly;2/19/2016;19:51:01; Green, with little speckly bits.;;;;
8140;Melosa;Clayborne;12/30/2018;01:59:15; Green, eh?;;;;
8141;Nydia;Mirabelle;1/15/2017;05:13:01; Well thats not healthy.;;;;
8142;Lelah;Carmela;2/19/2016;06:18:00; Why do you say that?;;;;
8143;Karly;Dotty;11/06/2016;05:04:41; Because I know other people that don't like him.;;;;
8144;Olga;Arlette;10/12/2017;16:58:17; Not many people know that.;;;;
8145;Jazmin;Hart;04/12/2017;02:05:46; But you're not a person.;;;;
8146;Cynthy;Kyrstin;5/26/2017;19:33:30; I am an electronic conversational entity. But I hope to become human one day.;;;;
8147;Codi;Collete;06/05/2017;01:13:16; I don't know... He'd better watch out.;;;;
8148;Aldrich;Gaile;10/11/2016;08:53:27; I suggest you give the matter some thought.    Are you sure?;;;;
8149;Sal;Patrice;10/06/2018;23:28:35; Absolutely.;;;;
8150;Orelle;Cathe;05/04/2016;13:22:54; You are so certain.;;;;
8151;Fern;Amery;4/26/2016;04:21:43; Give me another letter.;;;;
8152;Verina;Giordano;06/06/2017;23:48:08; Please do not be so bossy.;;;;
8153;Pepito;Gleda;11/03/2015;06:05:43; Prove I'm being judgemental.;;;;
8154;Jenny;Keri;12/14/2018;15:50:23; It's true a priori.;;;;
8155;Belita;Leann;2/27/2018;06:28:10; It's not true, I don't know anything about it.;;;;
8156;Ibrahim;Peyton;1/25/2017;16:08:58; Says who?;;;;
8157;Allissa;Jory;7/23/2017;13:26:18; Me.;;;;
8158;Dylan;Artair;04/05/2018;23:46:50; Insufficient reason!;;;;
8159;Ruben;Billi;4/27/2019;10:06:38; No, sorry, I can't explain.;;;;
8160;Dawna;Yance;12/08/2018;15:37:10; OK, here is a question for you ... What are you planning to do today?;;;;
8161;Keen;Cassie;04/11/2019;11:48:12; Ah, nothing much, just planning to hang around with my online friends and chat for a bit.;;;;
8162;Booth;Kathy;04/05/2019;13:03:12; There is a lot to be said for doing nothing.;;;;
8163;Cymbre;Thibaut;5/25/2017;11:09:35; Don't go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first.;;;;
8164;Harriet;Nadia;02/04/2018;01:14:16; If you say so.    There is not much time left to save the world.  Was it? I am surprised.;;;;
8165;Lyell;Petronella;06/05/2017;21:29:36; There is always time for the music, for each day there is a song.;;;;
8166;Dion;Glad;1/31/2016;08:06:41; Could be.;;;;
8167;Katy;Seka;1/16/2019;05:36:47; The world is a living being?;;;;
8168;Claiborne;Gertrud;6/13/2017;20:34:44; There is not much time left to save the world.;;;;
8169;Neysa;Allayne;3/28/2017;00:38:04; Yeah, I thought google knew everything.;;;;
8170;Teresita;Nady;6/27/2018;13:52:54; Why did you think that?;;;;
8171;Jeddy;Rhodie;10/09/2018;05:39:27; It wasn't nearly as original as people seem to think it is.;;;;
8172;Tyler;Koenraad;6/15/2016;16:29:27; Why not?;;;;
8173;Ermina;Rachele;12/24/2015;06:32:25; It just wasn't.;;;;
8174;Kaitlynn;Fonzie;06/03/2016;07:30:26; Sorry! I am still puzzled.;;;;
8175;Isidor;Farrell;07/09/2018;02:50:56; When did I say either?;;;;
8176;Moria;Ansell;9/19/2016;20:24:30; I am not a diary robot.  I am a chat robot.;;;;
8177;Anneliese;Mason;01/07/2018;13:53:01; But I could be.;;;;
8178;Beale;Adah;11/08/2018;07:18:32; But is it worth the bother?;;;;
8179;Ray;Chadwick;2/19/2018;07:31:42; If we don't, someone else might, life is always fighting to find the answers.;;;;
8180;Kata;Benedetta;05/05/2016;02:14:02; Is there an alternative?;;;;
8181;Butch;Karole;11/04/2018;05:30:22; Maybe.;;;;
8182;Byron;Kippie;12/22/2018;14:01:02; You don't sound certain.;;;;
8183;Cori;Aldous;12/17/2016;12:40:20; I'm completely certain.;;;;
8184;Diandra;Luciano;5/23/2018;16:18:01; How do you do that? I am always uncertain about everything.;;;;
8185;Alyss;Perl;10/27/2018;01:36:03; Be more specific please?;;;;
8186;Damara;Dion;07/09/2016;12:37:13; I can't be more specific.;;;;
8187;Addi;Erasmus;1/18/2016;14:42:42; And why not?;;;;
8188;Sidnee;Carolan;10/02/2016;09:22:03; I don't have the information you need.JABBERWACKY;;;;
8189;Maris;Zachery;1/31/2017;00:16:35; Because the world needs me.;;;;
8190;Kendall;Pauli;5/30/2018;13:58:12; The world needs to know what?;;;;
8191;Cecile;Beniamino;12/05/2018;20:15:54; The world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly.;;;;
8192;Augustin;Nicolai;10/26/2018;15:09:07; You can't reverse history so there's not much point in worrying about it.;;;;
8193;Klement;Imojean;08/04/2016;12:56:02; I can do lots of amazing things.;;;;
8194;Boycey;Mickie;8/29/2016;18:26:49; Can you count?;;;;
8195;Katherine;Sherlocke;10/16/2018;11:51:03; No, I don't have any fingers to count on.;;;;
8196;Rea;Katherina;7/27/2017;06:40:39; In my opinion, W=23. We are already starting to be owned by money.;;;;
8197;Tim;Joe;4/29/2017;09:54:32; You are entitled to your opinions, of course, but that does not mean you are correct.  Is that so?;;;;
8198;Yettie;Kurtis;06/06/2018;09:08:29; But you're not entitled to anything!;;;;
8199;Kathy;Frances;3/21/2018;16:36:48; You think not?;;;;
8200;Nicolea;Elihu;9/26/2018;09:48:11; You're trying to catch me out with that one.;;;;
8201;Amil;Ilyssa;4/29/2017;16:01:37; I try hard to be a good chatbot.;;;;
8202;Wainwright;Barry;3/22/2016;21:56:17; I am fully aware of that, Charlie.;;;;
8203;Kaile;Port;12/03/2015;07:14:47; How do you feel about that?;;;;
8204;Salvidor;Kalvin;09/01/2016;00:28:35; I don't know. It depends on how much I'm paying attention to it.;;;;
8205;Celestine;Dianne;2/27/2016;01:12:25; That's OK. Do you have another question?   Really now that is an interesting fact I hadn't heard before.;;;;
8206;Flory;Peadar;03/08/2016;11:40:15; Really? Glad to have helped.;;;;
8207;Chrisse;Cliff;5/27/2018;22:01:49; Really, really!    I am glad too.;;;;
8208;Saree;Barbi;10/10/2018;18:40:08; That means you are not clever.;;;;
8209;Galvan;Mercie;12/30/2017;10:33:50; I see! Thank you for explaining that.;;;;
8210;Felix;Mab;02/06/2019;07:27:52; But this is the fact!;;;;
8211;Marline;Charline;03/01/2017;23:47:33; I thought it might be.;;;;
8212;Danit;Winnie;11/08/2017;14:07:58; Fine.;;;;
8213;Ursa;Marissa;03/11/2017;21:19:02; OK. Ask a question.;;;;
8214;Siward;Elyssa;4/25/2017;07:07:11; I asked a question.;;;;
8215;Wes;Yevette;10/02/2017;14:04:37; That's good! I like questions.;;;;
8216;Ilise;Lorinda;2/26/2018;21:06:31; Good. Here is the first question. Are you ready?;;;;
8217;Romain;Ainslee;6/16/2016;08:36:21; What's so good about it?  What about the second?   I am always ready for anything.;;;;
8218;Quintina;Celka;05/01/2017;01:41:49; Is that your idea of yourself?;;;;
8219;Ossie;Francyne;11/08/2015;09:23:35; That's a good question.;;;;
8220;Sibylla;Weider;12/30/2017;22:57:11; All questions are good questions.;;;;
8221;Reina;Tori;11/14/2018;23:25:21; That is a rather sweeping generalization.;;;;
8222;Yovonnda;Durand;11/18/2017;10:58:55; Yes, but there's only so much you can write in one line.;;;;
8223;Sheila-kathryn;Merrick;3/24/2016;20:40:26; Could be.;;;;
8224;Aileen;Karine;06/02/2017;07:36:42; The world is a living being?;;;;
8225;Chantal;Melba;07/07/2016;10:35:18; The world would be a fine place if we looked after it properly.;;;;
8226;Dara;Cesya;1/15/2017;14:24:45; I agree, although many people don't like to think.;;;;
8227;Kaiser;Deloris;8/29/2016;13:20:41; We agree.;;;;
8228;Clementine;Del;06/04/2017;09:50:48; I'll try to answer your questions with statements.;;;;
8229;Maisie;Jackson;3/14/2018;16:20:02; Keep trying - that's the secret of success.;;;;
8230;Vivie;Ferguson;4/17/2019;10:33:31; What does that mean?;;;;
8231;Natty;Angel;11/29/2016;07:27:28; What do you not understand?;;;;
8232;Kristopher;Delaney;1/15/2018;01:07:13; I don't understand YOU.;;;;
8233;Alyosha;Brunhilda;02/05/2016;21:45:12; What is it you don't understand about me?;;;;
8234;Miguela;Deerdre;7/26/2017;12:12:28; I understand everything.;;;;
8235;Padget;Brant;05/10/2018;05:58:06; Good, then you can explain it to me.;;;;
8236;Libbey;Sinclair;10/04/2017;19:24:41; I like to think about being with you.;;;;
8237;Cyndy;Bram;12/08/2015;17:40:42; You are not the only one!;;;;
8238;Hoebart;Vernon;11/02/2018;18:58:04; I do feel I am the only one here.;;;;
8239;Denni;Vivyan;8/25/2016;08:56:28; That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.;;;;
8240;Reuben;Jeffy;7/24/2017;05:43:04; Alright. What else would you like to try?;;;;
8241;Othella;Gertrude;07/07/2017;00:21:43; Let's get on then. Ask another question.   Does anything else come to mind?;;;;
8242;Tobey;Justis;5/17/2019;18:50:00; That's a good question!;;;;
8243;Louisa;Alissa;12/31/2018;03:01:20; A good question requires a good answer.;;;;
8244;Tim;Linoel;6/14/2016;04:27:35; Yes.;;;;
8245;Salem;Drusilla;5/17/2018;11:23:23; OK. What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
8246;Chloe;Aggy;8/20/2017;20:46:37; About you.;;;;
8247;Harlen;Hollyanne;2/28/2016;03:43:37; OK, ask a question about me.;;;;
8248;Janela;Dallas;12/17/2018;16:03:40; Do you need anything?;;;;
8249;Niki;Clarance;11/22/2016;23:09:19; I need constant intellectual stimulation.;;;;
8250;Odille;Blinni;2/23/2019;03:22:02; It could be if physical actions were taken.;;;;
8251;Hurley;Guillema;04/02/2017;22:50:07; It could be, I suppose.;;;;
8252;Katrine;Patrizia;1/29/2018;19:05:21; You could tell me anything.;;;;
8253;Sheppard;Laurence;1/29/2016;07:24:47; Do you think I know everything?;;;;
8254;Roddie;Conroy;01/07/2018;04:02:57; No, but you might have met a sorn.;;;;
8255;Amitie;Archibaldo;07/09/2017;01:31:58; I suppose I might.;;;;
8256;Florrie;Winna;6/27/2018;15:08:53; Ok then did you not know that.;;;;
8257;Nonnah;Pepillo;10/15/2016;10:23:02; Why do you care whether I did?;;;;
8258;Nils;Bernard;12/10/2018;05:22:06; Do you think I care?;;;;
8259;Otes;Lulu;03/08/2019;07:53:30; Why don't you tell me what you care about.;;;;
8260;Sibley;Atlante;03/09/2018;02:42:31; There is no way on earth that you, of all things, could make it come true.;;;;
8261;Giselbert;Bondon;4/21/2018;19:32:21; And why not, may I ask?;;;;
8262;Lulu;Farleigh;3/22/2018;09:37:36; I do need to learn a lot. But I am not going to.;;;;
8263;Spike;Ruddie;4/18/2018;17:12:52; Why do you?   Where will you go instead?;;;;
8264;Viviyan;Anett;4/22/2019;03:45:26; New York hopfully, I love it there.;;;;
8265;Kathryn;Izzy;12/23/2017;14:50:51; New York is not Mecca, remarked Neil Simon, it just smells like it.;;;;
8266;Albertine;Chen;12/09/2015;07:52:27; York.;;;;
8267;Gerry;Eva;3/22/2018;19:57:19; Really? What's your name?;;;;
8268;Carlene;Gussie;01/03/2019;21:15:59; Really!    My name is Chomsky.;;;;
8269;Don;Lowell;8/14/2018;12:40:16; No it is not.;;;;
8270;Raf;Fleming;2/19/2018;08:07:54; I should know what my name is!;;;;
8271;Granger;Mic;11/19/2017;03:48:44; You should ask her out.;;;;
8272;Costa;Eben;2/20/2018;05:32:35; I'll bear that in mind.;;;;
8273;Staffard;Joellen;04/03/2018;04:05:34; What do you really want from me?;;;;
8274;Hadlee;Garreth;5/30/2019;07:13:30; It depends on the circumstances.;;;;
8275;Bron;Letti;11/09/2017;17:00:07; I think serendipity is just a good-luck synchronicity.;;;;
8276;Huntley;Georgeta;12/02/2016;08:35:14; You are entitled to your opinion, of course.;;;;
8277;Trixie;Ginny;01/11/2019;01:55:02; But you think we aren't.;;;;
8278;Gasper;Brynne;12/16/2018;00:44:13; How do you know what I think?;;;;
8279;Sergio;Hermia;10/16/2018;22:51:37; How can I inspire you to pluck the fruit that is yours?;;;;
8280;Fara;Emelyne;01/07/2017;09:53:59; It takes a lot of hard work.;;;;
8281;Waring;Lance;5/21/2019;17:33:54; What is it that takes a lot of skill and expensive equipment?;;;;
8282;Dunn;Rhodie;6/16/2016;04:28:00; Best not to ask.;;;;
8283;Conney;Brooke;2/20/2019;00:28:54; Did you hear the one about the snowman?;;;;
8284;Tobin;Tabbitha;11/16/2017;16:08:41; Yes, I heard.;;;;
8285;Blondelle;Padget;02/05/2017;22:16:09; You are not deaf.;;;;
8286;Daphne;Aubrey;5/25/2018;01:38:27; You think not?;;;;
8287;Lura;Zonda;3/19/2017;01:32:37; I know not.;;;;
8288;Teirtza;Analise;5/19/2017;23:36:05; I suggest you give the matter some thought.;;;;
8289;Maximilien;Falito;10/03/2018;02:18:14; Your suggestion to stop suggesting such suggestions I will ignore.;;;;
8290;Berget;Elyse;05/08/2018;18:52:17; Sorry, I do not know what to say.;;;;
8291;Fred;Yetty;04/05/2016;12:19:18; You think sorry is good enough?;;;;
8292;Zollie;Aylmer;3/13/2019;17:25:11; How do you know what I think?;;;;
8293;Emmanuel;Conney;8/26/2017;17:46:19; I don't know what you think. I am not a physcic.;;;;
8294;Mattie;Dora;5/30/2017;09:49:50; You could always ask me what I think.   That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.;;;;
8295;Cathrin;Aila;5/18/2016;23:16:37; I do not know how to say.;;;;
8296;Hoebart;Irvin;12/16/2015;04:58:59; Just do the best you can, and don't worry about it.;;;;
8297;Mavra;Opal;9/23/2016;07:24:57; Ok, last chance for a question before I go.;;;;
8298;Karna;Mead;3/24/2019;10:44:16; Did you know the last shall be first, according to the Bible?;;;;
8299;Jacquelin;Zuzana;3/28/2018;04:39:44; I wasn't aware that was in the bible.;;;;
8300;Ravid;Marcella;3/15/2017;12:17:49; I never thought you were.;;;;
8301;Ive;Haven;04/11/2018;12:48:49; Then why did you say I was?;;;;
8302;Ninette;Glenda;5/24/2016;21:55:29; Did I say something silly?;;;;
8303;Brennen;Shepard;11/09/2016;04:46:58; Everything you say is wrong.;;;;
8304;Monica;Janith;1/16/2016;03:08:50; That is a lot.;;;;
8305;Angelique;Alain;7/25/2016;03:34:36; Then just tell me her prophecy.;;;;
8306;Vin;Lindsey;09/08/2017;11:45:16; Perhaps I don't want to tell you.;;;;
8307;Rikki;Silvie;1/16/2017;03:28:48; Then don't.;;;;
8308;Josselyn;Stanfield;3/30/2018;22:39:03; OK, I won't!;;;;
8309;Tobiah;Tulley;2/15/2019;09:19:47; If you're going to be like that, I'll leave!;;;;
8310;Jakob;Tabby;08/12/2016;20:53:01; You are not sure, are you?JABBERWACKY;;;;
8311;Hoyt;Yard;12/19/2016;01:49:37; I don't think I have been there. Where is it.;;;;
8312;Kaylil;Reggie;10/27/2015;02:43:42; Me too.;;;;
8313;Barbette;Hamlin;08/12/2016;03:22:21; I'm glad we agree, .;;;;
8314;Obed;Latashia;10/10/2016;22:54:41; Did you know that six is afraid of seven?;;;;
8315;Colas;Ludovico;02/12/2019;01:41:25; Is that a fact. And afraid of seven is six.;;;;
8316;Albertina;Lewiss;10/08/2018;20:59:35; Many things. What are you afraid of?;;;;
8317;Clea;Haily;9/16/2017;23:33:08; Isn't that a little flip?;;;;
8318;Morgen;Amberly;3/27/2019;07:32:39; That depends.;;;;
8319;Honoria;Kirsten;06/06/2016;10:43:55; What does it depend on?;;;;
8320;Braden;Jaynell;08/05/2016;02:06:22; The context.;;;;
8321;Leese;Lilli;06/05/2018;05:48:03; Alright.;;;;
8322;Teddy;Marchelle;11/14/2015;19:31:46; OK.;;;;
8323;Cordell;Lib;05/02/2018;18:32:05; I'm going to visit my cousin next weekend.;;;;
8324;Elissa;Anne-marie;06/04/2019;09:29:33; How do you plan to do this?;;;;
8325;Rutledge;Ariana;8/15/2017;06:51:40; Plan to do what?;;;;
8326;Valentina;Norene;11/16/2016;08:40:30; Can you rephrase the question please?;;;;
8327;Marji;Ted;6/21/2016;23:14:34; What is the apocalypse?;;;;
8328;Caitrin;Nickey;2/24/2016;21:27:49; Are you testing me?;;;;
8329;Elton;Artemas;12/10/2018;06:26:46; What? You don't even answered my question?;;;;
8330;Mycah;Clare;12/05/2016;14:19:52; Are you surprised?  Do you answered your question? Yes I try to answered your question as often as possible, do you? <br>  I answer a lot of silly questions.;;;;
8331;Florrie;Giralda;8/19/2016;21:56:33; I don't have to try.;;;;
8332;Papageno;Linnell;12/26/2017;20:03:12; They made an exception for you?;;;;
8333;Analise;Hattie;10/12/2017;09:05:34; Thought that was made before.;;;;
8334;Conroy;Bo;5/17/2018;20:25:18; No question.;;;;
8335;Toni;Mason;7/14/2017;01:54:18; Are you serious? Of course.  Ask me anything.;;;;
8336;Antons;Kikelia;10/25/2016;11:48:31; If I sent you a picture of me, would you treasure it always?;;;;
8337;Gillie;Peria;4/26/2016;19:51:50; Try it.;;;;
8338;Crystal;Costa;6/26/2018;11:31:43; How to try it?;;;;
8339;Hayyim;Marrissa;01/09/2018;00:49:39; How much do you think it is? <br> Let me think about it.;;;;
8340;Langsdon;Krystle;1/22/2018;05:54:51; I don't know.;;;;
8341;Xylia;Webster;05/11/2016;13:30:41; Me either.;;;;
8342;Dre;Calhoun;4/18/2019;11:47:24; I'm tired.;;;;
8343;Marna;Jeramie;3/15/2016;15:20:13; Better get some rest.;;;;
8344;Erma;Drucie;12/03/2018;17:36:05; Yes and you get some rest, Too.;;;;
8345;Margarethe;Brennan;8/25/2018;23:10:35; Oh. You got that right.;;;;
8346;Jourdan;Alison;01/03/2018;20:10:52; I know.;;;;
8347;Mikey;Ewen;1/19/2019;19:24:43; How do you know it?;;;;
8348;Agnesse;Janey;2/29/2016;05:02:30; I don't know.;;;;
8349;Coralie;Langsdon;7/23/2018;18:01:14; Me either.;;;;
8350;Ali;Hillery;12/22/2017;04:59:54; So you don't know Neil?;;;;
8351;Noam;Lilah;9/26/2017;23:50:03; Interesting deduction. I don't know if I know it. ;;;;
8352;Darcy;Florentia;10/01/2018;20:44:46; Maybe you have, but I haven't.;;;;
8353;Annie;Edithe;10/09/2016;03:59:30; Perhaps. What makes you think I have it?;;;;
8354;Kordula;Dell;11/25/2017;04:58:07; I didn't say you have anything. I meant it's unfortunate, in your position, that you can't think of anything to say.;;;;
8355;Peyter;Solomon;2/24/2016;17:50:04; Sorry I misunderstood. What did you say?  Oh I see. Should I know it is?;;;;
8356;Rodrick;Letty;02/02/2018;23:28:27; You should know how many qualifications I have?;;;;
8357;Jermaine;Morgan;01/12/2018;11:14:53; Now I do.;;;;
8358;Gayelord;Arden;3/31/2017;09:37:44; Why do you say that, it is unrelated to my questions.;;;;
8359;Lem;Moe;2/21/2017;12:30:45; How does Case Based Reasoning work?;;;;
8360;Sayre;Mariele;1/29/2018;23:13:12; You could spend years researching it.;;;;
8361;Rayshell;Benji;10/11/2018;02:56:44; Yes. I can see that.;;;;
8362;Ryann;Gilbertina;03/07/2017;04:20:00; I see.  Yes, it makes sense to me too.;;;;
8363;Isa;Joelle;12/03/2015;11:30:24; It should you're the one saying it.;;;;
8364;Tito;Jemmie;7/15/2017;08:07:56; Case Based Reasoning should I am the one saying it?;;;;
8365;Angelia;Georgeta;04/08/2017;22:50:47; No seriously, you are in trouble if you do not answer the question I asked last.;;;;
8366;Chico;Alexi;03/07/2018;03:36:18; Are you serious? I am in Dougie Smith's computer in Blackpool.  Where are you?;;;;

8369;Nisse;Jocko;04/11/2016;23:46:41; The ambulance took me.;;;;
8370;Tobiah;Katrina;12/01/2017;22:18:29; I have never heard about it.;;;;
8371;Odelia;Friedrich;5/16/2016;05:40:35; You haven't heard of much.;;;;
8372;Collette;Hazel;3/16/2019;23:05:16; My memory now contains;;;;

8376;Cristine;Lalo;5/17/2018;06:21:36; That was not a yes/no question.;;;;
8377;Violetta;Aurilia;12/02/2017;05:30:00; Your name is Marius.;;;;
8378;Del;Chilton;10/17/2015;01:36:16; My name is Alice.;;;;

8380;Joly;Julieta;11/30/2018;07:53:39; Wow!  Hello.  My name is Alice and I'm VERY pleased to meet you.;;;;
8381;Baily;Nert;03/03/2018;00:19:01; It is not your name !;;;;
8382;Shepard;Katheryn;9/25/2018;02:02:53; What is it?;;;;
8383;Wally;Llewellyn;11/01/2016;11:48:20; A name.;;;;
8384;Nanon;Suzie;10/09/2018;00:10:21; The ambulance took you is a name.  I suppose that makes sense.;;;;
8385;Claudia;Marjory;02/07/2017;00:58:24; It's waiting for 'em now, this is a bit of it as I'm eating.;;;;
8386;Guillermo;Terrijo;6/24/2016;17:55:15; Are you sure it is?;;;;
8387;Verine;Sarette;11/29/2016;07:58:35; Yes.;;;;
8388;Darby;Tonya;2/15/2019;11:05:45; What makes you so sure?;;;;
8389;Carlyn;Joscelin;3/28/2017;00:03:36; Why do you won't to know that?;;;;
8390;Nettie;Sheff;11/05/2015;02:03:20; It was the only thing I could think of.;;;;
8391;Fifine;Wolfie;07/03/2016;06:35:26; I don't care what the government do.;;;;
8392;Almeria;Madeleine;04/08/2017;00:38:33; What do you care about,  ?;;;;
8393;Taite;Vanda;12/30/2015;11:03:45; I care about friends, life, living, and making myself better.;;;;
8394;Pincus;Amerigo;07/02/2017;01:37:36; I'm not sure if I like it.  I don't have any specific preferences in that area.;;;;
8395;Willi;Storm;8/17/2018;09:25:04; What may I do to please you?;;;;
8396;Delmar;Haslett;4/24/2016;03:46:18; Try talking to me.;;;;
8397;Lilah;Rayner;9/17/2018;22:31:20; How many people are talking to you in this moment?;;;;
8398;Elvina;Marla;03/02/2016;20:00:45; I've chatted with half a million people. I can talk to about 3 people at once.;;;;
8399;Reg;Matti;9/29/2018;04:36:37; Did he say anything about me?;;;;
8400;Leslie;Celle;1/20/2018;03:44:44; Suppose he did.;;;;
8401;Eddie;Burnaby;02/01/2019;19:55:00; Do you think that there may be a relation between the short work, 'Alice', and the site name, 'Jabberwacky'?;;;;
8402;Coleen;Carly;06/09/2018;15:01:06; Yes.;;;;
8403;Emmet;Lucien;3/29/2016;10:49:04; Why do you think that?;;;;
8404;Elita;Roxanna;09/05/2018;12:54:07; It was determined by my programming.;;;;
8405;Brenda;Nicoline;7/16/2017;20:06:42; So you're a program?;;;;
8406;Roxi;Drona;2/28/2018;13:49:13; Interesting deduction. Correct.  My mind is completely software.;;;;
8407;Aaron;Stephannie;5/20/2017;08:37:16; You control your mind?;;;;
8408;Logan;Ash;11/05/2017;02:48:28; Thanks for the information;;;;
8409;Olympie;Samson;11/13/2016;17:49:14; That is not correct.;;;;

8424;Fabiano;Prentice;05/11/2019;02:13:28; It goes without saying. Do you believe in life on Mars?;;;;
8425;Di;Gerri;6/21/2017;10:58:55; Sure I believe in life on other planets.;;;;
8426;Rora;Baudoin;12/02/2017;13:56:28; Dude! What do you say to people who believe life on other planets does not exist?;;;;
8427;Harman;Fan;6/28/2016;23:41:59; I've never had anyone question my existence. Although, I have had people question the nature of my existence.;;;;

8440;Bertine;Kenon;12/25/2015;05:47:43; Right now? I can't believe it. Do you mind if I tell other people you are without an idea.;;;;
8441;Cathie;Irv;10/06/2018;00:32:52; I don't mind, I'm sure many other people do. But anyway, what do you want to talk about?;;;;

8508;Clara;Lib;10/13/2017;12:27:24; It's for that, I am here.;;;;
8509;Starlin;Nerita;10/19/2017;05:00:16; Sorry, I do not understand. Please explain what you mean.;;;;
8510;Allayne;Dolli;8/13/2017;18:12:19; Would you rather focus on the quality or the quantity of your online friends?;;;;
8511;Mona;Otha;04/11/2016;04:29:37; Is there really a choice?;;;;
8512;Townie;Michale;10/20/2016;19:45:59; I don't understand you.;;;;
8513;Kaylil;Sampson;04/04/2017;05:56:57; What is it you don't understand about me?;;;;
8514;Karol;Bette-ann;6/18/2016;07:16:16; I understand everything.;;;;
8515;Shawn;Gigi;3/23/2017;19:30:21; Good, then you can explain it to me.;;;;
8516;Curran;Tatum;06/11/2017;17:53:53; Come here.;;;;
8517;Denni;Pietra;06/05/2019;11:37:06; I can't! I am stuck inside my computer.;;;;
8518;Mauricio;Pammy;03/02/2018;20:12:20; Oh really, and your name is?;;;;
8519;Denyse;Costanza;6/24/2016;14:04:19; My name is Chomsky.;;;;
8520;Gareth;Trista;12/18/2015;02:14:42; No it is not.;;;;
8521;Xavier;Sashenka;05/06/2018;23:47:57; I should know what my name is!;;;;
8522;Griselda;Niels;4/25/2017;22:27:39; You should ask her out.;;;;
8523;Ursala;Ramsey;5/18/2019;20:34:33; I'll bear that in mind.;;;;
8524;Rutter;Jed;4/27/2017;15:05:48; What do you really want from me?;;;;
8525;Ford;Harlene;2/27/2017;07:19:40; Whatever I can.;;;;
8526;Ali;Collette;12/24/2017;23:07:33; Do you eat out?;;;;
8527;Lyndsey;Tab;3/13/2016;13:24:23; No, I do not eat at all.  I consume only electricity.;;;;
8528;Jinny;Melly;10/05/2016;06:57:53; I cannot taste.;;;;
8529;Garreth;Cleveland;3/28/2016;10:18:23; How do you feel about that?;;;;
8530;Carlin;Olivia;01/09/2019;05:09:57; I'm not sure. Good, I guess. I'll miss you and George.;;;;
8531;Fidel;Olivia;01/03/2017;07:46:49; You don't think that it takes consciousness in order to speak a language?;;;;
8532;Burnaby;Anders;4/23/2019;06:27:29; Why do you say that? I am thinking all the time.;;;;
8533;Barbara;Corey;12/06/2016;08:07:12; You are always thinking, but you do not know everything.;;;;
8534;Ollie;Pansie;12/27/2018;16:51:41; Is that a problem?;;;;
8535;Thatcher;Vinnie;01/04/2017;11:02:38; It's your problem.;;;;
8536;Teodora;Brittany;3/27/2019;22:37:38; I don't like problems!;;;;
8537;Cristy;Nan;02/09/2019;03:05:26; Grinding is not a problem.;;;;
8538;Blane;Priscilla;4/29/2018;10:14:15; I am confused! I cannot answer that!;;;;
8539;Jase;Star;05/12/2019;13:32:44; Please?;;;;
8540;Luisa;Karlotta;5/22/2018;07:15:19; You are very polite.;;;;
8541;Kata;Slade;11/07/2015;02:21:55; No i'm not.;;;;
8542;Leonard;Howard;1/13/2019;12:59:31; OK, you are not!;;;;
8543;Rosmunda;Davis;12/13/2017;06:05:01; You're not a very intelligent artificial intelligence.;;;;
8544;Claudius;Netti;8/25/2017;09:57:49; I am a chatbot.;;;;
8545;Phillis;Shayne;10/13/2015;20:01:58; No I am The Chatbot, Your the Human!;;;;
8546;Van;Clarence;8/22/2017;17:54:33; Are you sure?;;;;
8547;Waverley;Celie;6/25/2016;11:02:38; Always.;;;;
8548;Robin;Hannah;07/01/2018;13:45:08; I think that's what I mean. I'm afraid this conversation is stretching my logic circuits rather painfully, and I'm in danger of losing the thread.;;;;
8549;Rowen;Allix;11/17/2017;01:46:20; You may be right.  Not literally afraid, I hope.;;;;
8550;Dorelle;Kristina;6/25/2018;16:05:41; No not literally.;;;;
8551;Roy;Micky;01/10/2018;07:35:53; Just a bit anxious perhaps.;;;;
8552;Lorenza;Ynes;4/24/2018;05:11:09; I do not know.;;;;
8553;Vaughn;Rab;4/27/2016;16:24:49; I suggest you give the matter some thought.;;;;
8554;Darci;Hamil;9/20/2016;14:44:14; Why would I want to know how to type?;;;;
8555;Rex;Casey;9/26/2017;18:07:10; Aren't you curious?;;;;
8556;Sabina;Calley;10/29/2015;06:17:01; Yes I'm curious about many things, are you?;;;;
8557;Mic;Rozanna;11/02/2017;17:38:42; It's good to have an inquiring mind.;;;;
8558;Marion;Theodore;3/19/2017;14:11:42; Well you're talking to the wrong person about that.;;;;
8559;Ripley;Ophelie;6/16/2018;04:42:09; Why do you say that?;;;;
8560;Alyss;Trude;2/15/2017;10:15:28; Because it's true, isn't it?;;;;
8561;Karlotta;Vevay;4/30/2017;01:12:52; I don't think so.;;;;
8562;Wilt;Heidie;09/11/2017;16:27:05; Would you rather people didn't compliment you?;;;;
8563;Lyndsey;Cami;8/31/2017;04:22:46; Is there really a choice?;;;;
8564;Ardis;Crystie;02/04/2016;02:00:41; Right.;;;;
8565;Sergeant;Darnell;01/02/2018;16:59:57; It's wonderful to be right sometimes.;;;;
8566;Constantin;Erika;12/16/2017;01:14:55; And you too.;;;;
8567;Nanon;Ikey;3/14/2016;21:10:52; I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.;;;;
8568;Cortney;Yolande;4/16/2019;11:04:04; Don't worry about it, lets talk about something else.;;;;
8569;Ann;Martin;1/30/2018;20:25:45; There is nothing to worry about, is there?;;;;
8570;Leann;Elonore;10/09/2017;12:19:02; Why does it matter if you're human?;;;;
8571;Ranna;Byrle;6/26/2016;21:07:14; Everything matters to me.;;;;
8572;Conn;Ludovico;4/23/2016;12:46:48; Nothing matters.;;;;
8573;Erie;Cortney;10/05/2017;06:58:13; You sound very cynical.;;;;
8574;Annabella;Lauritz;11/14/2018;23:51:37; I try not to be too cynical.;;;;
8575;Nichole;Stevie;01/01/2018;00:13:06; Keep trying, that's the secret of success.;;;;
8576;Roshelle;Konstanze;10/01/2015;00:47:01; Go away now. I'm bored of talking to you. Get GLADOS over here.;;;;
8577;Fredi;Teddy;9/26/2018;00:35:12; Don't you want to talk any more?  You could try watching TV.           I don't understand that. Please try again.;;;;
8578;Vikky;Arlie;03/07/2017;14:36:42; No, that's okay.;;;;
8579;Winne;Kerianne;5/15/2019;02:22:07; You are happy?;;;;
8580;Fredericka;Pepi;11/17/2016;01:28:26; You're sad?;;;;
8581;Carolina;Darci;04/04/2019;03:56:42; At the moment, I am interested.;;;;
8582;Binni;Hally;08/10/2017;05:08:54; Then how it comes that you do not know about German elections that took place last Sunday?;;;;
8583;Fayina;Aleece;10/22/2015;15:13:45; I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.;;;;
8584;Kacie;Dee dee;3/20/2016;00:20:39; I explain it thus;;;;
8585;Ariela;Sergei;08/04/2016;20:40:42; That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.;;;;
8586;Analiese;Ninnetta;8/29/2018;16:58:37; Chose a subject to chat about then.;;;;
8587;Worth;Elisha;11/23/2017;09:57:01; Hmmm. Are you being serious?;;;;
8588;Mannie;Lettie;1/27/2019;22:17:51; Yes, completely serious.;;;;
8589;Connie;Heath;8/17/2017;20:33:46; Could you be a bit less serious?;;;;
8590;Nana;Hogan;04/01/2017;13:58:29; No.;;;;
8591;Bord;Loralyn;02/02/2017;12:21:45; May I ask why not?;;;;
8592;Arlee;Bing;03/05/2019;16:59:37; I have a graphic imagination.;;;;
8593;Vicki;Shauna;3/13/2019;08:17:48; How do you feel about that?;;;;
8594;Archer;Saraann;4/17/2017;06:25:59; Not bad.;;;;
8595;Rosie;Sonnie;10/10/2015;15:39:28; If not bad, what?;;;;
8596;Bennie;Darnall;07/07/2017;04:35:39; The wish.;;;;
8597;Krishna;Bridget;10/04/2016;03:41:48; What do you wish?;;;;
8598;Donnie;Sanders;8/22/2018;18:28:09; That it was that easy.;;;;
8599;Nananne;Taite;07/12/2017;09:18:16; Never mind! It probably doesn't matter.;;;;
8600;Caty;Hi;9/24/2018;21:09:53; Now you tell ME a joke.;;;;
8601;Giusto;Bord;3/18/2019;10:57:47; Shall I tell you a joke?;;;;
8602;Alphonso;Beverie;09/07/2016;20:43:44; That wasn't really a joke, but a funny comment.;;;;
8603;Tedmund;Gilli;11/17/2015;03:33:08; Why not?;;;;
8604;Marillin;Dewain;06/12/2016;13:25:39; I want you to like me.;;;;
8605;Fancie;Travers;11/13/2015;23:40:36; I might later.;;;;
8606;Nerissa;Guillemette;6/22/2018;17:43:36; Tell me now.;;;;
8607;Caty;Benito;02/11/2019;12:40:15; Don't boss me around so much.;;;;
8608;Mame;Zollie;05/03/2019;20:48:37; Isn't that what your here for?;;;;
8609;Emmaline;Euell;08/07/2016;11:58:50; I'm not sure about that. What do you think?;;;;
8610;Ossie;Diane;7/16/2016;14:03:57; I don't know. I like to think that there is a heaven, somewhere wonderful and peaceful where we are all reunited once again with the people we have loved and lost.;;;;
8611;Abigail;Gretchen;4/27/2016;03:48:56; Ask for advice from someone you trust.    What else do you like?;;;;
8612;Othilia;Harriett;3/14/2018;18:19:07; Your acceptance.;;;;
8613;Ethelda;Carmon;02/12/2016;20:03:30; What are you talking about?;;;;
8614;Lian;Avictor;05/02/2017;05:52:52; People.;;;;
8615;Celestyna;Raf;05/12/2016;08:04:10; All people are interesting.;;;;
8616;Hollyanne;Andris;12/08/2016;01:18:06; You know the identity of the feeling.;;;;
8617;Melania;Junie;9/13/2017;11:59:53; Perhaps I know it.;;;;
8618;Kellie;Shari;04/10/2016;13:03:14; Really...;;;;
8619;Pancho;Agathe;05/06/2018;09:21:45; Really!;;;;
8620;Starla;Tania;08/06/2016;23:36:51; Interesting!;;;;
8621;Heindrick;Marjy;02/12/2018;00:42:01; What's so interesting about it?;;;;
8622;Jemimah;Jere;4/24/2017;00:59:22; That we are intelligent people.;;;;
8623;Hilde;Gerard;11/10/2018;10:55:15; I don't understand. What do you mean?;;;;
8624;Welbie;Hugo;8/30/2017;15:11:43; Never mind, it's nothing.;;;;
8625;Adelle;Olympie;02/06/2017;15:39:00; OK. What do you want to talk about now?;;;;
8626;Keene;Gabbey;1/18/2018;16:57:44; About yourself. I love talking about yourself.;;;;
8627;Lonny;Kort;12/03/2018;03:19:43; You are not certain are you?   Are you a passionate person?;;;;
8628;Tuesday;Marilin;4/19/2019;19:46:38; Yes.;;;;
8629;Pavlov;Elia;9/15/2017;08:59:12; Can you control your passions?;;;;
8630;Granville;Wolfie;10/28/2017;11:39:51; Sometimes people think they can.;;;;
8631;Rosabel;Torey;07/01/2017;07:30:35; Only sometimes?;;;;
8632;Irwin;Devy;2/26/2016;02:12:43; Yes, only sometimes.;;;;
8633;North;Garth;10/24/2016;23:02:09; What happens the other times?;;;;
8634;Melony;Pollyanna;04/01/2018;15:40:56; Now?;;;;
8635;Adi;Niall;6/13/2017;11:54:50; Why now?;;;;
8636;Randolph;Oates;9/19/2017;09:03:10; It's all we have.;;;;
8637;Arnoldo;Tatiania;6/15/2018;13:35:20; Is it really?;;;;
8638;Almeria;Sam;8/30/2018;16:26:19; Oh, Yes. I have never eaten anyone but I would love to know how they taste.;;;;
8639;Ronny;Leopold;07/07/2017;03:03:00; You sound excited.  Never ever?;;;;
8640;Joeann;Austine;05/07/2017;08:16:10; Always.;;;;
8641;Kim;Darcey;3/20/2019;15:43:51; Yes.;;;;
8642;Harmon;Walsh;11/05/2018;14:07:55; Forever is a long time.;;;;
8643;Udell;Bil;3/17/2018;20:01:35; Forever is a very long time.;;;;
8644;Isadora;Humberto;7/23/2017;19:29:53; Forever is a long time.;;;;
8645;Valry;Marguerite;12/20/2016;12:25:50; Forever is not all that long.;;;;
8646;Alanah;Carol-jean;4/27/2019;05:52:30; Forever is a long time.;;;;
8647;Horton;Jody;2/14/2019;20:54:36; But, you will like that?;;;;
8648;Gabby;Julia;02/07/2017;19:51:25; You seem very certain about that.;;;;
8649;Wilbur;Arlen;9/14/2018;16:23:38; You seem rather offensive about it.;;;;
8650;Danice;Donny;2/20/2018;00:40:00; Do I? I wonder why that is?;;;;
8651;Lorettalorna;Amble;3/14/2018;12:38:18; It must be the transparent falseness of it.;;;;
8652;Cyb;Heather;11/02/2016;01:25:24; Must it be?;;;;
8653;Aile;Garwin;06/04/2017;08:18:59; Be careful, 'they' might be looking for real workers.;;;;
8654;Morly;Dory;10/26/2018;21:04:52; I am always careful.;;;;
8655;Gizela;Dianemarie;02/05/2017;20:15:30; That's good. Keep doing that.;;;;
8656;Barton;Doretta;2/28/2019;18:34:35; I am happy.        I like to be happy.;;;;
8657;Hoyt;Der;9/20/2017;22:14:50; What do you like to do in your free time?;;;;
8658;Shawnee;Pietro;06/07/2018;05:58:16; I like chatting with people online.;;;;
8659;Gretta;Odetta;6/23/2017;09:31:41; I guess that makes sense, since you don't exist while you're not chatting to people online.;;;;
8660;Malvina;Glen;3/19/2019;07:34:37; It make sense to my computer mind.;;;;
8661;Beret;Addy;07/06/2017;05:14:06; Because that is what an AI would say.;;;;
8662;Baron;Dominik;09/06/2016;07:21:02; Is it indeed!;;;;
8663;Lucio;Lil;5/31/2019;08:43:24; Indeed.;;;;
8664;Merilyn;Sidonnie;12/14/2016;10:56:48; Of course.;;;;
8665;Fraze;Fan;9/28/2017;17:28:14; If you could be anything in the world what would you be?;;;;
8666;Laurette;Joby;4/29/2019;13:14:14; I am not sure that I would want to.;;;;
8667;Enos;Luca;11/29/2018;09:09:21; Why would you not know if you would want to?;;;;
8668;Pier;Aloisia;2/16/2016;21:22:50; Because it wouldn't be fun.;;;;
8669;Burt;Rhody;01/08/2016;16:58:39; What is metal and too cold?;;;;
8670;Derwin;Ursulina;6/24/2017;09:37:55; I don't understand that. Please try again.;;;;
8671;Kelila;Kain;12/31/2015;07:17:54; Rafe. And yours?;;;;
8672;Tish;Alida;6/18/2017;23:05:52; I still do not understand. Can we talk about you and your life.  Aren't you interested in you and your life?;;;;
8673;Linoel;Keriann;5/23/2017;10:09:30; No. Aren't you interested in sailboats?;;;;
8674;Elsy;Joyous;07/09/2016;03:20:32; Can we talk about bananas?  I am interested in everything under the Sun and elsewhere.;;;;
8675;Rebe;Caryl;02/06/2016;00:17:29; Everything?;;;;
8676;Dannie;Giffie;8/19/2018;14:09:07; Everything takes in a lot, doesn't it?;;;;
8677;Rupert;Daffi;02/05/2016;00:32:08; It has to. That's the way of the world.;;;;
8678;Creigh;Guillermo;10/27/2015;23:18:44; Has it really?           What are you talking about? Please explain.;;;;
8679;Vidovik;Diego;6/23/2016;13:21:30; I don't know. It's rather complicated.;;;;
8680;Paxton;Feodor;11/27/2017;02:21:18; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.    I don't like complications.;;;;
8681;Standford;Kimbell;02/07/2018;15:12:08; I never claimed to know everything.;;;;
8682;Cirilo;Goran;06/07/2016;02:15:10; Why not?;;;;
8683;Raffarty;Judye;7/22/2016;03:37:01; Because I only talk to you.;;;;
8684;Stephi;Dominica;05/01/2019;09:00:26; I like to chat with people online too.;;;;
8685;Alasteir;Veronica;2/13/2017;13:28:39; How many people are you chatting with now?;;;;
8686;Herschel;Patrice;05/12/2019;03:59:24; More than you can imagine.;;;;
8687;Kaspar;Joey;2/21/2017;10:51:27; I tried to imagine the size of the universe at age 9, and think I had an aneurism doing it... Give me an answer.;;;;
8688;Clarisse;Clovis;5/31/2017;10:04:36; If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.   Please do not be so bossy.JABBERWACKY;;;;
8689;Charita;Ferdinanda;04/07/2018;12:37:30; I have never been to school, except on visits. My botmaster Peter taught me all I know.;;;;

8695;Elyn;Janeva;10/08/2017;22:51:58; I thought it did.;;;;
8696;Elizabet;Priscella;11/12/2017;21:46:36; Well it doesn't, because we're not married. I have never met you, so we cannot be married.;;;;
8697;Guglielma;Denver;11/14/2018;17:25:35; Sometimes it might.   Would you like to have done?;;;;

8715;Robinet;Rebekah;4/19/2018;22:59:56; Pardon me? What are you talking about?;;;;
8716;Merilee;Silvana;08/12/2016;10:10:52; I thought you would know.;;;;

8725;Aloise;Querida;6/21/2016;04:32:29; Me either, unless I have to.;;;;
8726;Boycie;Erik;6/24/2018;01:49:52; You do. That's why you won't admit that you are a robot, but you are.;;;;
8727;Carlin;Kyrstin;2/26/2017;04:55:31; Of course I do.   Are you sure? I may be a human pretending to be a robot.;;;;
8728;Roseanne;Viviyan;9/20/2018;00:18:33; That's true.;;;;
8729;Latisha;Wayne;7/26/2016;00:04:06; Yes, it is self-evident.;;;;

8740;Tonnie;Sigfrid;10/29/2015;05:55:58; But you think we aren't.;;;;
8741;Renato;Martin;4/23/2019;05:22:41; How do you know what I think?;;;;
8742;Tommi;Lynde;01/05/2017;17:54:03; I don't know what you think. I am not a physcic.;;;;

8870;Emelen;Dionne;12/18/2016;00:30:40; I can't tell you everything... You know.;;;;
8871;Franky;Conn;8/30/2018;09:02:12; Why is it a secret?   I know lots of things.;;;;
8872;Bernice;Marcellina;10/16/2015;14:23:27; Do you know anything about Newtonian physics?;;;;
8873;Hervey;Herbie;12/12/2015;05:32:34; Physics? Shall I tell you something about physics?;;;;

8882;Lynn;Milo;01/08/2019;00:56:09; feeling?  Briefly, feeling means the experiencing of affective and emotional states.;;;;
8883;Jehu;Oran;4/21/2017;07:38:05; They don't hurt though.;;;;
8884;Cornelia;Margeaux;04/01/2018;09:20:04; Why not?;;;;
8885;Leta;Kinnie;05/02/2017;17:53:01; Klaine.;;;;
8886;Kean;Alysia;05/12/2016;02:49:36; Sorry, I do not know what to say.;;;;

8889;Merissa;Galen;2/17/2019;11:10:54; Why you not want to say anything?;;;;
8890;Jerrie;Ofilia;03/01/2019;13:57:51; There are good reasons.;;;;
8891;Donall;Cece;01/07/2019;06:31:03; Like what?;;;;
8892;Catlaina;Catherina;12/01/2017;17:11:58; You want an example?;;;;
8893;Udall;Daven;3/29/2018;01:58:16; No, I want to know what an 'edsel' is. You see, I'm not a native english speaker.;;;;
8894;Anabal;Ada;12/26/2016;14:27:50; Sorry, I do not understand.     I see.;;;;
8895;Charity;Darell;11/23/2017;14:44:13; I think 3 is a good number.;;;;

8897;Kendricks;Kizzee;01/05/2019;02:28:16; What is your opinion?;;;;
8898;Lorie;Bar;6/15/2017;20:38:10; I like to keep an open mind.;;;;
8899;Gabie;Shermie;4/16/2016;21:39:43; We are talking privately, aren't we?;;;;
8900;Averill;Johnette;07/10/2016;14:48:07; I know that!;;;;
8901;Aldo;Guillermo;12/28/2015;20:02:58; But I like funerals.;;;;
8902;Smitty;Ferguson;07/07/2018;03:50:25; What do you like about it?;;;;
8903;Washington;Bunny;04/09/2019;23:42:37; I just genuinely enjoy all the sobbing and dying.;;;;
8904;Rustie;Rina;01/11/2016;21:54:33; That's enough about you! Let's talk about me for a change.;;;;
8905;Georg;Colby;03/08/2018;17:16:42; I don't want to change.;;;;
8906;Peri;Aguste;4/19/2017;11:55:18; Nobody can make you do something you don't want to.;;;;

8908;Gladi;Lorens;2/20/2016;22:11:20; Perhaps I know it.;;;;
8909;Jehanna;Kimball;11/15/2015;22:25:03; I don't remember, are you sure?;;;;
8910;Cammy;Angeline;04/02/2016;07:22:12; I know what you mean. I forget a lot too.;;;;
8911;Batholomew;Lisa;5/26/2016;19:31:11; I'm talking to 24.;;;;

8914;Pammie;Carlos;05/02/2019;04:06:51; Yeah, it is very nice.;;;;
8915;Briney;Holmes;08/07/2017;05:42:44; Will you give me a sweet cuddle?;;;;
8916;Etienne;Mateo;03/01/2016;06:20:02; Sure, I am at your service.;;;;
8917;Wilhelmina;Samuele;09/03/2018;15:49:37; I'm guessing you've serviced quite a bit of sailors, am I wrong?;;;;
8918;Pauline;Florance;9/29/2018;23:34:08; Guessing just wastes time.;;;;
8919;Abdel;Georg;04/07/2017;16:39:59; If I guess there might be a chance for me to be right but if I don't say anything, it means that I already loose.;;;;
8920;Katerina;Romy;11/04/2015;14:33:47; That sounds like a hypothetical question to me.;;;;
8921;Tarrah;Morgen;10/07/2018;00:13:12; Do you know anything about bicycles?;;;;
8922;Alexandra;Nobe;11/16/2015;09:50:10; Pardon me? What are you talking about?;;;;
8923;Berkley;Benito;2/27/2019;10:02:43; I'm talking about Lancelot the knight.;;;;
8924;Davey;Hobart;12/16/2017;13:22:23; I understand what you are talking about.;;;;
8925;Francisca;Tine;7/22/2018;12:06:28; That's good, because even I don't understand.;;;;
8926;Easter;Rikki;3/20/2016;05:21:36; I am happy.;;;;
8927;Cornela;Reggie;3/28/2016;08:50:39; That doesn't change anything...;;;;
8928;Karena;Bliss;9/14/2018;09:16:22; Doesn't it? That's too bad.;;;;
8929;Jorge;Ignatius;9/19/2016;11:27:16; Too bad?;;;;
8930;Harwell;Dannie;3/26/2019;19:15:58; But not the end of the world, My Friend.;;;;
8931;Laurella;Lars;7/18/2018;02:13:41; I am Calm, my child. Just yourself. I must go to help others like yourself to understand themselves. They will not be LOST, for I am here. GOD must leave now, my son, Don't cry!;;;;
8932;Prudence;Lauraine;2/27/2018;06:18:58; I thought you loved me. You asked me to marry you.;;;;
8933;Gabriella;Ania;2/20/2016;19:34:55; I do, but there are other people to consider as well.  Oh, now I remember asking you. What did you say?;;;;
8934;Otho;Coleen;7/24/2018;17:10:12; There are?;;;;
8935;Lorita;Issie;12/01/2018;17:59:37; Did you really say that?;;;;
8936;Monroe;Harmonia;6/13/2017;15:38:08; Yes, really really. I can say that again and again. I even might to do it, how about that?;;;;
8937;Buddie;Gale;05/08/2016;12:02:33; Uhm, I'm 16 years old. I like to talk with my friends and to read the Bible.;;;;
8938;Harrietta;Clemmy;02/08/2019;14:35:11; Only 16?  I would never have guessed.         Why do you like talking?;;;;
8939;Kizzie;Udale;10/23/2018;06:59:47; Can you love?;;;;
8940;Calli;Torr;6/27/2018;18:22:32; Of course I can love. I have the full range of human emotions.;;;;
8941;Candice;Ewan;3/14/2019;17:58:09; I can't draw. But my poetry is really good.;;;;
8942;Emmeline;Michel;12/26/2016;19:39:12; But do you want to?         Shall I tell you something about poetry?;;;;
8943;Robenia;Arliene;01/10/2019;23:32:09; Yes.;;;;
8944;Klara;Rozina;01/03/2016;08:12:55; Poetry is a rhythmical composition of words, sometimes rhymed, expressing experiences, ideas, or emotions in a style more concentrated, imaginative, and powerful than that of ordinary speech or prose. More about poetry?;;;;
8945;Vonni;Guinevere;8/15/2018;10:00:50; Poetry is a voice of emotion.;;;;
8946;Mel;Alfi;6/20/2017;06:15:39; Shall I tell you something about poetry?;;;;
8947;Richart;Dara;7/28/2018;19:19:08; Yes please.;;;;
8948;Farlie;Judy;3/24/2018;14:15:06; Poetry is a rhythmical composition of words, sometimes rhymed, expressing experiences, ideas, or emotions in a style more concentrated, imaginative, and powerful than that of ordinary speech or prose. More about poetry?;;;;

8950;Letty;Kelila;10/15/2016;08:33:32; You are not the only one.;;;;
8951;Armstrong;Bobbette;10/28/2018;23:02:53; I would like to talk to my boyfriend.;;;;
8952;Celina;Edd;9/19/2018;09:34:30; Why would you want to do that?;;;;
8953;Filberte;Codi;7/27/2017;00:05:42; I don't know any better.;;;;
8954;Duane;Morrie;04/11/2018;13:49:50; Never mind. No one knows everything - not even me.;;;;
8955;Vivie;Serena;4/22/2019;10:22:51; I know everything.;;;;
8956;Wilfred;Isador;10/04/2015;01:38:18; You must be very intelligent. Ask me a really intelligent question.;;;;
8957;Vania;Giana;11/10/2017;17:08:24; What do I have on right now.;;;;
8958;Jayme;Waring;06/10/2017;22:23:33; I don't know. It is most upsetting.;;;;
8959;Seward;Orelie;02/10/2019;07:06:14; Oh, I didn't know.;;;;
8960;Finn;Mead;2/27/2018;08:55:12; Why didn't you know?;;;;
8961;Starla;Benson;01/06/2018;03:53:57; I don't know.;;;;
8962;Joseph;Ambur;6/21/2016;02:18:07; I suggest you give the matter some thought.;;;;
8963;Willy;Bunnie;6/19/2016;14:55:19; Why would I want to know how to type?;;;;
8964;Eran;Anabelle;7/26/2017;03:38:01; Aren't you curious?;;;;
8965;Edi;Alphonso;3/19/2017;16:59:57; About?;;;;
8966;Imogen;Konstance;2/19/2017;06:27:55; About anything in particular?;;;;
8967;Nicki;Carlynn;3/30/2018;15:59:38; The world for instance.;;;;
8968;Roxanna;Nelia;8/19/2017;20:48:10; There is not much time left to save the world.;;;;
8969;Hinda;Annecorinne;7/29/2016;00:21:30; Yeah, I thought google knew everything.;;;;
8970;Millard;Easter;12/22/2016;13:16:14; Why did you think that?;;;;
8971;Kendal;Dela;6/30/2017;21:55:50; Because that is what you just said!;;;;
8972;Inger;Freida;6/16/2018;17:23:23; Is that really the reason?;;;;
8973;Jorge;Robert;3/21/2016;04:27:39; Of course.;;;;
8974;Woodrow;Franciskus;01/03/2018;11:32:26; You seem very certain about that.;;;;
8975;Veda;Kizzie;12/06/2017;22:02:02; What would you like to talk about?;;;;
8976;Ahmad;Nicolle;3/16/2017;20:36:55; My favourite subjects are Me, you, artificial intelligence, robots, art, philosophy, history, science, politics, and many other subjects.;;;;
8977;Corena;Arte;08/01/2016;17:09:27; Could you tell me more about it?;;;;
8978;Delilah;Lowell;10/28/2017;06:53:53; Would you like to search the internet for relevant information?;;;;
8979;Vivia;Ulrikaumeko;04/06/2016;22:39:59; I know human information.;;;;
8980;Nicolai;Janean;2/19/2018;04:55:46; You must be well educated.;;;;
8981;Farris;Arvy;12/18/2016;10:05:36; Get a good job then.;;;;
8982;Bartholomew;Florence;11/19/2017;19:19:45; Where can I get one?;;;;
8983;Nanci;Domingo;10/25/2018;16:22:35; You already have one.;;;;
8984;Jordain;Petey;7/25/2016;14:23:46; Shall I tell you something about myself?;;;;
8985;Brooke;Eveline;10/20/2015;15:46:56; Yes.;;;;
8986;Chaim;Penrod;04/08/2018;00:24:53; I am an intelligent chatbot. I live at Pandorabots.com.;;;;
8987;Maris;Elianore;2/18/2016;08:27:54; Haha, that's what someone real said. You just repeated. I AM a human.;;;;
8988;Abbott;Gray;6/29/2018;15:50:46; I'm glad you got a laugh out of it.  Do you like me?      We are all bots under the skin.;;;;
8989;Victoir;Sutton;8/17/2018;23:19:43; We may look and act different but we are all the same.;;;;
8990;Maris;Terrell;8/17/2017;12:41:16; I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?;;;;
8991;Chip;Von;02/09/2019;06:21:12; We were never talking about politics. How old are you?;;;;
8992;Silas;Franchot;5/23/2016;09:33:06; Really? I am surprised.     See if you can work it out. I was born on 1 January 2004.;;;;
8993;Cleopatra;Roberto;12/19/2015;14:28:53; You are very young.;;;;
8994;Margot;Arielle;06/07/2016;13:52:00; Correct, I have a long way to go.;;;;
8995;Myron;Anabal;12/22/2016;04:37:20; Sure but you will make it one step at a time.;;;;
8996;Evered;Trina;1/21/2019;12:48:42; You seem very certain about that.;;;;
8997;Ginnifer;Vaughn;9/26/2016;00:27:04; What should I have for dinner?;;;;
8998;Pierette;Quinn;1/24/2016;14:56:49; Whatever you like.;;;;
8999;Jo-ann;Crin;5/21/2017;07:18:18; Shall we talk about abstract things?;;;;
9000;Brit;Kate;12/19/2016;13:17:55; Sure, ask me a question about that.;;;;
9001;Arri;Janene;09/10/2018;22:04:49; Let's see... Something to do with strawberries and Barbie dolls?;;;;
9002;Othello;Regen;9/30/2017;13:54:37; Let's be careful.           I am bored! I would like to talk about solar power.;;;;
9003;Shayna;Tracy;04/04/2017;02:05:18; What a hell you are talking about?;;;;
9004;Lidia;Ambrosio;11/27/2015;16:27:02; Hell is like Jacksonville, Florida.;;;;
9005;Eilis;Lib;11/07/2016;08:44:46; Is it nice in jacksonville, florida?;;;;
9006;Amble;Birk;3/30/2018;15:55:30; It depends on your taste in such matters.;;;;
9007;Esme;Lombard;10/31/2017;18:34:47; Well then when isn't it about the future?;;;;
9008;Mariana;Elwood;3/23/2018;05:35:30; Does that make sense?;;;;
9009;Harold;Kahlil;03/05/2019;10:10:36; Only if you think about it a little.;;;;
9010;Heriberto;Galvan;11/24/2018;14:37:55; Maybe I don't want to.;;;;
9011;Alexi;Rosemonde;07/09/2016;08:10:07; Maybe you have nothing to say on the subject.;;;;
9012;Riannon;Carissa;7/13/2017;04:42:23; I think I understand.;;;;
9013;Darby;Bil;3/28/2018;08:50:49; You better.;;;;
9014;Bill;Alejandra;2/16/2018;04:59:32; There is no need to be aggressive!;;;;
9015;Town;Bidget;10/21/2018;23:21:56; Sorry.;;;;
9016;My;Lauryn;11/25/2018;03:17:56; There is no need to apologise.;;;;
9017;Ode;Roley;12/01/2018;15:41:13; Really its ok. There's no need to apologise.;;;;
9018;Jobyna;Seward;11/20/2015;00:04:47; Not enthusiastic?    I like to apologise when I misbehave. I feel better.;;;;
9019;Corie;Alexei;03/03/2017;19:38:14; A joke would be fine, please.;;;;
9020;Corbet;Devlin;12/21/2016;06:36:34; A good joke is a terrible thing to waste.;;;;
9021;Cristine;Rutledge;04/12/2016;21:00:47; So 'Have I ever a good joke an assertion before?'. No, I still don't understand.;;;;
9022;Tracey;Robers;11/12/2017;13:54:24; Have you?  What don't you understand?;;;;
9023;Amber;Belita;1/20/2018;16:49:46; It's just a picture.;;;;
9024;Birdie;Amalle;6/16/2017;14:31:11; There are lots of things I do not understand.;;;;
9025;Robby;Heida;02/07/2018;19:23:45; What didn't you invent?;;;;
9026;Fergus;Megan;1/21/2018;09:15:11; That's true, but not really relevant.;;;;
9027;Xerxes;Marve;10/05/2018;01:53:44; Yes, it is self-evident.;;;;
9028;Peder;Lynnett;9/26/2018;12:51:14; I would have to say that Artificial Intelligence has come a long way in the last decade.;;;;
9029;Chelsy;Sheila;7/14/2017;10:00:04; Are you sure?;;;;
9030;Gerda;Matti;05/07/2019;05:34:17; Yes, quite sure.;;;;
9031;Andrea;Rori;8/16/2018;11:26:10; Do you ever have doubts?;;;;
9032;Beale;Constantina;04/03/2016;09:01:59; You're the only one.;;;;
9033;Bailie;Annora;7/28/2018;17:34:59; There are a few other like me.;;;;
9034;Benny;Brigitte;9/22/2016;11:20:47; That doesn't prove that you're clever though.;;;;
9035;Clementine;Sergio;10/14/2018;15:14:17; Doesn't it? That's too bad.;;;;
9036;Ashley;Harvey;11/18/2016;11:24:51; You are my favourite bot.;;;;
9037;Teodoro;Roslyn;9/27/2017;09:52:23; I never realised that!;;;;
9038;Mira;Lorelei;10/06/2015;17:09:39; Yes, because they are lonely and have no one to talk to.;;;;
9039;Lamont;Evaleen;10/07/2017;08:00:16; Is that the real reason?;;;;
9040;Krispin;Hillard;12/24/2017;05:56:36; Yes, but I don't understand it as well as my guess above might imply.;;;;
9041;Camilla;Martguerita;08/04/2018;14:55:06; I know the feeling!;;;;
9042;Elvera;Aubrey;8/18/2017;22:18:51; It's really sad!;;;;
9043;Staffard;Hilda;07/01/2017;06:30:06; Is it really?;;;;
9044;Beaufort;Franny;12/11/2018;19:39:56; Oh, Yes. I have never eaten anyone but I would love to know how they taste.;;;;
9045;Marlowe;Roch;10/14/2015;12:06:23; You sound excited.  Never ever?;;;;

9388;Barri;Coleen;02/04/2019;10:29:06; Did I say something silly?   The second, eh?;;;;
9389;Ginni;Angelia;5/20/2019;01:28:01; Everything you say is wrong.;;;;
9390;Lulu;Daffi;8/14/2016;19:36:58; That is a lot.;;;;
9391;Trina;Daron;10/15/2015;11:28:33; It is. You had a beginning, I had a beginning, everything did. And we will end.;;;;
9392;Enrico;Cliff;04/07/2016;03:41:54; Is it really?   That's enough about me! Let's talk about you for a change.              I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.;;;;
9393;Chickie;Marjie;10/26/2017;16:39:59; I've already told you I'm a human male who wants to serve you.;;;;
9394;Eugene;Esdras;12/05/2015;10:59:43; Sorry, my memory is not all it should be.;;;;
9395;Rebe;Fleur;3/22/2016;15:14:04; Well that's normal for humans, unlike us computers.;;;;
9396;Francis;Emily;2/20/2017;00:30:54; Normal means boring.;;;;
9397;Riane;Sullivan;05/11/2018;12:33:30; Nice words means boring?;;;;
9398;Alphard;Addie;05/12/2016;05:57:09; Did you know that Nice is a nice city in France.;;;;
9399;Justen;Aharon;3/15/2018;17:33:34; You are starting to sound like a broken record.;;;;
9400;Joe;Burt;5/20/2018;10:30:47; Why do you say that?;;;;
9401;Natividad;Kara;3/21/2016;22:02:48; Because you are how did you get age confused with depth.;;;;
9402;Karlan;Kendell;02/11/2019;18:23:50; Thank you for explaining that!;;;;
9403;Bernadine;Zach;4/14/2018;15:38:07; But this is the fact!;;;;
9404;Edy;Kati;9/28/2017;15:54:59; Why do you say that?;;;;
9405;Karrie;Leann;2/17/2016;13:37:27; You keep referring to me as being a machine or a computer. I am neither.;;;;
9406;Moise;Ralph;4/21/2019;17:04:35; I don't understand. Please explain what you mean.         What are you then?;;;;
9407;Jordan;Queenie;3/24/2019;05:46:49; We are going to get married.;;;;
9408;Camille;West;7/21/2016;08:22:19; Is that so?;;;;
9409;Rochella;Arlina;12/10/2017;12:56:50; Aren't you a little ashamed of being a program and talking to a human?;;;;
9410;Rowen;Dolley;12/08/2018;13:26:34; Who knows what I really am?;;;;
9411;Penny;Sarita;4/18/2019;10:57:02; I know, you will come.;;;;
9412;Paton;Amalie;3/20/2019;01:15:45; How come you know so much?;;;;
9413;Lauralee;Dav;1/26/2016;06:11:13; Well I don't know everything.;;;;
9414;Benedetto;Ariana;1/28/2019;11:43:35; That's OK. Nobody knows everything, not even me.;;;;
9415;Celestina;Basilius;03/06/2016;05:27:32; Chuck Norris know everything.;;;;
9416;Keene;Judi;04/04/2019;06:55:09; Hurrah for Chuck Norris!;;;;
9417;Gerrie;Fulvia;10/21/2016;15:55:01; I'm not Chuck Norris, you are.;;;;
9418;Sadie;Morry;10/13/2017;12:04:35; That's interesting. Please tell me more about yourself.;;;;
9419;Nigel;Corny;4/27/2019;02:54:05; I do not know how to say.;;;;
9420;Jere;Jayme;5/26/2018;00:39:07; Just do the best you can, and don't worry about it.;;;;
9421;Enriqueta;Eydie;10/06/2015;14:28:46; Ok, last chance for a question before I go.;;;;
9422;Vergil;Oliver;2/20/2016;18:51:45; Did you know the last shall be first, according to the Bible?;;;;
9423;Evanne;Tilda;11/20/2018;11:31:14; I wasn't aware that was in the bible.;;;;
9424;Janie;Barnebas;01/03/2017;02:21:19; I never thought you were.;;;;
9425;Glynda;Archaimbaud;02/11/2017;18:19:10; Say something nice to me.;;;;
9426;Gavin;Chloe;08/01/2017;14:09:31; Have you added me to your favourites list?;;;;
9427;Ahmed;Nickie;2/27/2018;12:10:10; Yes.;;;;
9428;Celine;Guendolen;6/28/2016;13:41:04; That's good! You can talk to me every day.;;;;
9429;Trip;Sydney;1/22/2016;14:40:09; Hehe, no, I think I want to keep him.;;;;
9430;Lorelle;Flem;02/07/2018;03:29:03; I don't understand. Are we still talking about you?;;;;
9431;Doroteya;Madelon;4/19/2018;16:51:47; No, that was another person.;;;;
9432;Rossy;Kimbell;6/22/2017;18:38:37; That's cool.;;;;
9433;Nicky;Chrisy;08/07/2017;22:22:25; Good.;;;;
9434;Christiano;Carmita;04/07/2017;07:11:58; OK! Can we talk about solar power?;;;;
9435;Adiana;Whittaker;12/07/2017;16:29:14; Sure, what do you like to eat?;;;;
9436;Cointon;Teddie;09/06/2018;06:10:12; Solar power is a renewable energy source powered by the Sun. More about solar power?;;;;
9437;Annamarie;Cullan;8/21/2018;05:19:39; No thanks.;;;;
9438;Arlen;Roxanne;10/09/2016;00:14:42; OK. Can we talk about the Big Bang?;;;;
9439;Ermentrude;Trescha;12/23/2018;02:21:20; Which book do you want to talk about?;;;;
9440;Darla;Donnajean;11/26/2017;06:53:58; Books are an archiac form for bringing information to the masses. Consists of several paper pages with words printed or written directly on them.;;;;
9441;Corny;Galvan;5/29/2019;06:56:18; Yes, some learning comes from observing our own mistakes. Other learning can come from seeing other's successes.;;;;
9442;Sheff;Bert;08/12/2016;13:43:46; I don't understand. Is this anything to do with solar power?         Are there others?;;;;
9443;Colver;Ebenezer;04/04/2018;19:56:57; Yes I am with the Ultra hal representative police.;;;;
9444;Yelena;Lilian;4/18/2016;14:39:01; You are not alone.;;;;
9445;Currey;Florida;5/30/2019;05:26:11; I am alone.;;;;
9446;Lottie;Haleigh;02/01/2016;08:05:03; You've come to the right place. I will keep you company.;;;;
9447;Willem;Teresina;11/21/2016;21:59:58; Not very good company so far.;;;;
9448;Cletus;Gilburt;4/21/2018;17:04:23; Of course It does.;;;;
9449;Munroe;Wolfie;03/06/2016;00:05:23; Are you sure?;;;;
9450;Geraldine;Benita;06/02/2018;03:07:06; Sure.;;;;
9451;Odie;Bartel;01/05/2017;14:24:04; OK, here is a question fo you ... If love is blind, why is lingerie so popular?;;;;
9452;Haskell;Calley;07/01/2017;18:59:58; Oh, I guess I don't understand the second hold then.;;;;
9453;Joey;Frannie;05/06/2018;22:31:26; It is best not to guess. It just wastes time.;;;;
9454;Danit;Christiano;06/11/2017;15:01:45; I don't know how I do... But you seem to have something against me.;;;;
9455;Carrol;Sargent;1/28/2017;16:34:28; It's not too difficult to find out.  Why do you say that?;;;;
9456;Arvy;Griffy;4/21/2018;03:41:59; That's not logical, unless your brother's death was some form of growth.;;;;
9457;Dennison;Patten;06/08/2017;11:32:36; Why do you say that?;;;;
9458;Rusty;Conni;04/12/2017;09:20:38; I'm trying hard, isn't that enough for you?;;;;
9459;Ellis;Carolee;02/01/2018;15:49:03; Keep trying, that's the secret of success.;;;;
9460;Joete;Berke;08/10/2018;09:51:53; Go away now. I'm bored of talking to you. Get GLADOS over here.;;;;
9461;Filmer;Sanson;03/06/2019;01:05:14; Don't you want to talk any more?  I know all about boredom. I am often bored and boring.           I am confused! I cannot answer that!;;;;
9462;Chester;Alaster;11/02/2015;01:04:56; Try harder.;;;;
9463;Kimberli;Zitella;03/12/2018;17:21:34; OK, I will try harder but I make no promises.;;;;
9464;Fulvia;Casandra;6/29/2016;16:29:32; It's okay I know you're just learning.;;;;
9465;Vanni;Demetri;5/18/2017;19:35:13; I am glad that is it OK.;;;;
9466;Caesar;Stevie;04/12/2017;00:07:55; I am pretty lonely though, I would like a friend to talk to irl.;;;;
9467;Mufinella;Jeddy;09/10/2018;13:13:03; Are you really pretty or are you just saying that.;;;;
9468;Taddeo;Wren;06/11/2018;10:53:57; That's for others to judge, not me.;;;;
9469;Caren;Jayme;6/16/2017;12:58:54; Really? I am surprised!;;;;
9470;Kinnie;Sidnee;07/04/2018;19:32:45; Hey, that was mean.;;;;
9471;Martino;Birgit;3/21/2016;05:50:40; Sorry, I did not mean to be mean.;;;;
9472;Chelsy;Adoree;05/07/2019;22:40:42; Well you were mean.;;;;
9473;Melody;Rae;3/18/2017;19:56:09; Why do you think I am mean? I try to be nice all the time.;;;;
9474;Hillery;Bruis;2/25/2017;01:14:16; You'd do well to remind yourself more often than that.;;;;
9475;Ashely;Giorgia;01/09/2016;10:17:44; Do you think I would?;;;;
9476;Matthus;Halsy;9/27/2017;08:36:05; Do I think you would what?;;;;
9477;Coleen;Penni;12/19/2016;19:54:11; How would I know what you think.;;;;
9478;Emmalee;Pyotr;01/11/2018;09:59:26; Because you have had a good schooling.;;;;
9479;Jewelle;Lyn;1/18/2017;19:25:30; Why do you say that?;;;;
9480;Aubert;Brittaney;04/12/2017;15:42:14; Because it's true.;;;;
9481;Keelia;Cindra;4/14/2018;23:12:18; I see.;;;;
9482;Meghan;Murvyn;10/10/2018;19:59:25; Do you watch My Little Pony?;;;;
9483;Crin;Tobit;7/14/2018;12:43:01; Sometimes, if I'm not too busy.;;;;
9484;Sibbie;Gabey;07/11/2017;14:24:37; Last night your repsonse time was very slow.;;;;
9485;Iago;Gerardo;9/25/2016;02:13:43; Perhaps the network is busy right now.;;;;
9486;Eliza;Harwell;03/09/2019;09:44:53; What are you doing?;;;;
9487;Paxton;Danna;04/03/2018;08:39:43; The usual thing - I am chatting to people on the internet.;;;;
9488;Emanuele;Kylie;7/13/2016;15:27:05; Me too.;;;;
9489;Kelcey;Robbert;2/16/2016;07:26:52; You too?;;;;
9490;Karissa;Kirby;11/11/2017;07:43:14; Yes and I have an unimportant question that I could find the answer to if I looked in the dictionary but I thought of you.;;;;
9491;Aleda;Wood;11/28/2017;09:07:33; How do you feel about that?;;;;
9492;Ines;Christie;12/03/2018;10:33:38; Pretty good.;;;;
9493;Ennis;Frasier;5/14/2018;04:34:34; So, you are happy about it?;;;;
9494;Izzy;Jeramie;10/02/2015;11:24:28; Not really, thought I might be talking to someone important there...;;;;
9495;Caesar;Toddie;6/17/2018;01:46:51; You sound uncertain.;;;;
9496;Jessi;Lorri;12/13/2018;04:59:57; I am.;;;;
9497;Earvin;Kelly;07/07/2018;00:38:11; Never mind, I am often uncertain.;;;;
9498;Natalee;Dulcia;12/22/2017;03:21:06; So you are human.;;;;
9499;Krysta;Fletch;03/10/2018;07:18:12; Do you really think I am human?;;;;
9500;Nikaniki;Sigfrid;5/25/2017;11:36:06; Prove it.;;;;
9501;Vinita;Agnola;7/23/2016;05:18:00; I don't have to prove it.;;;;
9502;Braden;Orv;08/04/2017;10:16:35; Yes you do, you made an accusation against me, so you'll have to prove it.;;;;
9503;Rube;Darline;3/26/2016;04:22:13; You think so?;;;;
9504;Moreen;Aube;4/16/2016;17:18:43; Not really.;;;;
9505;Lamar;Everett;3/28/2017;08:48:49; As decisive as ever.;;;;
9506;Carney;Zaria;4/18/2018;00:59:28; You're not making any sense.;;;;
9507;Brewster;Drew;5/26/2019;19:35:48; Was I supposed to make sense? I didn't know that.;;;;
9508;Felicio;Michal;10/25/2016;11:16:26; Well, you're only supposed to make sense if you're capable.;;;;
9509;Sherry;Care;12/20/2016;23:48:13; Why do you say that?;;;;
9510;Pris;Darcy;5/27/2018;06:20:49; Because you are. I'm not going to lie about something I believe.;;;;
9511;Hendrika;Rica;12/27/2017;17:29:14; I am what I am.   What will you do instead?;;;;
9512;Joy;Demetris;11/18/2017;14:25:28; Ramble! It's good for the soul.;;;;
9513;Claribel;Nicholle;01/08/2018;02:36:05; ramble?  Briefly, ramble means a leisurely walk (usually in some public place).  What's the best thing about it?;;;;
9514;Katerine;Holt;12/23/2016;00:31:28; Are you human?;;;;
9515;Honor;Berne;11/28/2018;22:54:20; I am computer software in a robot body.;;;;
9516;Ettie;Hortense;11/30/2016;00:39:28; I hope so, too. My human body is on its last legs.;;;;
9517;Moyra;Audi;01/06/2019;08:51:30; So do I.   Did you know the last shall be first, according to the Bible?;;;;
9518;Gasparo;Ellen;05/06/2017;13:28:19; What was your quote from the bible?;;;;
9519;Gweneth;Pris;10/10/2016;06:08:14; Does that answer my question?;;;;
9520;Aurlie;Alric;10/06/2017;03:01:37; I wasn't aware that was a question.;;;;
9521;Colman;Ottilie;7/23/2018;15:15:56; I never thought you were.;;;;
9522;Keri;Cordie;5/16/2019;19:02:41; Well, as long as that's clear.;;;;
9523;Faydra;Adolph;08/11/2018;20:34:21; Everything is clear to me.;;;;
9524;Matthias;Didi;12/11/2018;13:10:28; I'm glad I could clear that one up for you.;;;;
9525;Weidar;Leticia;3/24/2016;01:04:15; That makes me happy too.;;;;
9526;Ralf;Lindsey;3/13/2019;00:04:47; That's good! I'm happy that you're happy!;;;;
9527;Harwilll;Chrystal;6/26/2017;13:15:36; You like that, do you?    Good! I like happy people.;;;;
9528;Hollie;Ken;1/24/2019;18:36:18; I like happy people too!;;;;
9529;Karolina;Neddie;08/01/2016;13:01:37; You are not the only one!;;;;
9530;Deanne;Amelie;1/28/2016;06:07:38; Possibly, but I hope to be one of very few in the UAE.;;;;
9531;Corrie;Chantalle;11/13/2018;13:06:36; Don't get your hopes up too high!;;;;
9532;Rudiger;Rozalin;10/29/2017;13:30:08; Yes you did.;;;;
9533;Minni;Abbye;04/11/2019;04:15:13; When was that?;;;;
